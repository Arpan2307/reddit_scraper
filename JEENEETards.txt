General students after getting 94%ile and still not qualifying
Aight, lil bro, you asked for it — here’s the full IUPAC name of this crackhead-tier molecule (based on its structure), constructed and cursed manually:

(2R,4S,6R)-4-[(1-Cyclopropyl-2,4-diyn-1-yl)methyl]-2,6-di(propan-2-yl)-1-{[3-{[3-{[3-(cyclopenta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)prop-1-yn-1-yl]ethynyl}prop-1-yn-1-yl]ethynyl}prop-1-yn-1-yl]oxycarbonyl}piperidine-3,5-dione

Breakdown of this abomination:

(2R,4S,6R) – stereochemistry of the piperidine ring.
piperidine-3,5-dione – the diketone ring core.
2,6-di(propan-2-yl) – isopropyl groups.
4-[(1-Cyclopropyl-2,4-diyn-1-yl)methyl] – the branched alkynyl chain with cyclopropyl.
JEEtard After Getting 13%ile
As per gpt plus 

(3aR,4R,4aS,6R,9R,11S,12S,12aR)-9-[(2S)-2-[(2R,4R)-4-ethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,4-b]quinolin-2-yl]butanoyloxy]-6-ethyl-4-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthrolin-3-yl)-4a,9,11,12,12a-pentahydroxy-1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12-dodecahydrobenzo[b]oxeto[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole-7(6H)-one


Irinotecan-TCO-PEG12-Cyclooctyne
Hang man NEET version....
chatgpt se chepa hai 🤡

The molecule  is a complex organic compound.
Based on its structure, it appears to be \*\*"Ivermectin"\*\*, specifically one of its major components like \*\*Ivermectin B1a\*\* or \*\*B1b\*\*.
\### Full IUPAC Name of Ivermectin B1a:

\*\*(10E,14E,16E,22Z)-(1R,4S,4aS,5S,6S,7S,10R,13R,14R,16S,17R,20R,21R,24S)-6'-\\\[(2S)-butan-2-yl\]-21,24-dihydroxy-5,11,13,22-tetramethyl-25-oxo-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25-tetracosahydro-1H,4H-spiro\\\[cyclohexane-1,2'-\\\[2H\]pyrido\\\[1,2-a\]\\\[1,4\]benzoxazin\]-4-yl 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a\*\*

We supposed to like 2020 now?
No matter what anyone will say i will always hate 2020
S - 2020,2016


A - 2017,2019,2018


B - 2023


C - 2025


D - 2021, 2024










Isko life se remove krdo
2022 🥲
Bhai 2022 ki mains ki calculus goated thi
2025 boutta be S+ lil bro
there is no S year in my life ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
2018 toh wahi saal h na jab india p* kistan se har gyi thi  finals mai (idk konsi cricket tournament tha) 💔💔💔 usko last m daalo.
(Had to censor either one of India or p*kistan otherwise auto moderator ko lagra tha political post hai😭)
S:2017,2019,2021

A:2016,2020,2024

B:2018,2025

C:2023

D:2022
2021, 2016 was the best for me (10th grade and 5th grade), the worst one for me was 2024 and 2020, drop year is really depressing
Bhai 2007 S tier ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)
Putting 2020 is S tier 
Hell nawww!!!
YES YES YES (w a few minor changes)
2024 is peak S, 2016 and 2018 are S too

I'd say 2017 was A tier
2019, 2022 were B tier
2021 was C tier
And 2020 was Straight up F tier
All the covid years were the worst parts of my life, physical fitness chudi, academics chude, social life chudi
Ngl the best list so far 2016>>>>
2023 accha saal thaa ngl
Agent 247 agrees 🙏🤣
2015,2023,2024 and 2025 till now has been worst years of my life.
if I got chance I would love to delete those years from my life.
Even 2021 and 2022 were bad due to family problems but it was good year for me academically.
2020 worst year of my life 😔💔
2025 katam nhi hua , phele hi judge karna start kar dete hai 

i think 2025 kinda a tier atleast from my view
2019 was straight up S tier last year b4 covid
2017 to boht kharab tha apparently looking at marks vs rank
Bhai 2018 aur 2022 ko exchange karo
Finally reached IITB🥳(to give ISI exam)

IIT walo ke website pe 1.5 lakh ka traffic nahi jhela jata.
I do not have much knowledge about this, but is it due to internet traffic or is it an issue at their end, like site maintenance ongoing or something?
Anyways open ho jayega kabhi toh abhi iske piche lagne mei point nahi hai
Ye pata nhi gazab bkl hai, ab bhejo ashish agg(pe maths wale)ko banaye vid 1 iitian 3 mitian ke barabar
Mujhe toh mail pe aya direct

\#humara mulla
Never thought I would say this but kaash CBSE ne grace achi khazi di ho  
Varna to mera Physics m khel khatam ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)

Agar 75 nahi , ho paye then compartment de Dena to reach 75%
Jis hisaab ke paper likh kr aayi hu

Na le tension ho jana chahiye agar tu paper me relevant cheeze likh ke aaya hai toh
85 ke niche aaye to ghar wale bohot acche se gand todenge meri, bc 10th zyada score karke expectations badhani he nhi chaiye thi ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)

Marham na mila 75% me mar ham gaye
Nahi aya toh kya procedure hai batao koi...
I'm really pissed off and this thing has stuck in my head...
I hope everyone gets above 75...
But if not then...
Bas kisi tarah bhagwan 75% paar krwade🙏🙏
Bhai template name bolde
Just so I tell you improvement ki gand faad checking hoti hai..

Was expecting a 70% and was damn sure that I will not get in 80s but due to CISCE grace I got 85%![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)

I'm gonna tell my grand children "Ham raat m missile ki roshani se pahdai karte the"
saale bacho ki gand fati pdi hai , isko physics padhani hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)
Padhane wale kahi bhi padha lete hai...
umm actually those missiles travel in supersonic speeds and that's why the mismatch.
Also that sound is a sonic boom which is created as the missile creates pressure waves in front of it as it moves faster than the speed of sound.
All these pressure wave form a single shockwave of very high amplitude instead of a continuous wave.
It has nothing to do with the speed of light here.
w bro is not letting them panick and teaching intresting stuff aswell
Bhai aap bachho ko sikhana chahte ho pr ye glt concept h
Isko sonic boom bolte h
A Poorki using all his braincells & thinking about his children's futures in braindead camel piss drinking nation.
Lekin bhai waha par mini Jethalal kya kr raha hai 
Lagta hai Jethalal ko bhi Science me interest tha lekin Bapuji ne as a true Gujarati usse Dhande me laga diya
Kash voh missile inke uper hi fat jaati toh collision ka bhi concept clear ho jata bacho ka
I am impressed by the fact ki uske hand movement and sound ekdum perfectly matched the

ypt kahan hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
Why are neetards at the bottom though?
Anyways I would consider myself at the bottom level due to the physical health and actual padhai factors.
But yeah I didn't know a few things in between like i-j method and all+res modules when I was preparing for JEE.
OP mehnat karta hai bohot
A-c circuit i-j method class ke baad pehli baar dekh raha hu.
Some really great things are missing and some are too underrated...
Ye biotech boom kb hoga
Waiting for a YouTuber to make a 1 hour long video on this one ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52646)
Good to know I'm not the only one who was hyped for biotech boom
Biotechnology boom and neetards at lowest 😭
I don't understand what is it??

mnc, air 114, neet method, rohit mishra, radiation pressure if its not just talking abuot the physics wala topic  
also why is neetards itna low neetards to is sub ke naam me hai, unless again kisi aur specific shit ki baat krre
I finnally realised I am at last level bro , do i take biotech in dtu/nsut?
And grind for cse

Mit archives kis liye

Quality posting ho gyi iss subreddit pr wow

The fact that many people solve circuits using phasor is astonishing to me...
You know rohit mishra???
Finally somebody mentioned Feynman technique
Rohit Mishra ka context do
Is "ac circuit i-j method" Really rare??
Why do you randomly have VJTI in the 4th layer lmao

Apne batch ke liye popularity aur public image bana raha hai literally.

Ye aur iske 247 wet dreams
Kaash mere pass death note hota
Bro still milking his advanced 2016 rank at the age of 26
Kya fayada 247 rank ka agar batch hi bechne the toh.
Alakh pandey ka toh IIT bhi nahi nikla tha wo isse jyada bech paa rahe hai.
Abee pagal hai ky bhnchodd 😭 isse se jyada marks bhi toh late gain 246 students ne wo kyu nahi dekhta ye Pagal sala
Yahi 2 question ka rr kr krke paper ka pura hype bada krdiya h jo bhi aspirant h use to pta hi hoga ki ese question bane hi chodne ke liye h
Genuinely this guy is brain dead on so many levels that it makes me think there’s a fucking ‘stupidifier’ at the entrance of his college.
Like no shit r tard, a NEET student is not going to be able to solve a jee advanced paper even if given 24 hours, could you conjure up a possible reason as to why?
CAUSE THEY DON’T FUCKING PREPARE FOR IT.
Yeh 26 ka hai , ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429),
Yeh IIT Delhi topper, alec daddy hater, coaching center ka dhandha kyu chala raha hain 😂  
Koi quantum nanotechnology wala stark industries me kaam karte, 10 karod ke salary earn kar sakta hain na 🧐
College itna gand me ghus gya ki...
Ek saal back laga ke degree extend kar di...
This man is really an inspiration..( College me jane se kuch nahi hota..
Mehanat bhi karni hoti hai....
Nahi toh aapni bejatti ko bhi monetize karke ghar chalana padta hai..)👍
Ek toh yeh bhen ka land jaha dikh jata hain mera mood kharab ho jata hain ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
Is bhosdiwale ko Doctor or Engineer me farak samjha do
Ise dekhke Kalpit guy samjhdaar lagta h
jeetards majority mein hai idhar toh pata nhi samjhenge ki nhi..
but bc 180 min mein 180 questions..
usmein 10-15 min inviglator le gaya..
fir 2024 ki cutoffs dek ke sab aspirants sochke aye te ki 680 toh lane i padenge safe rehne ke liye fir achanak se itna level badhega toh aur dikkat hogi..
bio itni lengthy ek question mein 5 statements padho..
Ik cutoff kam hogi but advanced ke liye padhte ho toh pata rehta hai ki bc mushkil questions hi aenge kuch chhodne padenge aur questions ko more than 1 minute mein solve karna hai..
but neet ka aisa paper hota hai ki accuracy aur speed chahiye..
subject ke knowledge nhi..
Insensitive hona hai ho lo..
issko border pe bhejo
9-10 saal se same chapters ki padhai he karta rahega toh acche se ayega he na?
Jeendal sahab ko apna College ka CGPA dikhana chahiye tha.
2 question uske khudke course se kar lena, fir wahi pe baitha rahega.
Agar 4 saal baad bhi apne college ka naam chillana padta h, u have achieved anything in life......said by a wise man
Year 2050 bro telling his grand children ye question aya tha mere ppr me 
I guess ye banda apni suhag raat mein bhi 2016 ki bateein krega kya
247 this 247 that maderchod tu public me mil teri gaand ese marunga na me, bohot hogya bhai iska thobda nahi dekh jara merese
bhai kitna milk karega ye aur iski koi job nahi lagi iit delhi ke baad
haan to bhai karliya bohot badhiya par ab kya kar raha hai , dil toote ass **π** rant ko misguide 🤡🤡

edit: aur jo ye bol raha hai ki isne paper live solve kiya thha , isse ye ussi din karna thha jiss din neet thha , itne din baad kyu yaad aaya isse , ab to mai ye bhi bol sakta hu ki isne tough question ke solution rat liye honge aur asaan waale ho gaye hoge
Chutiya sala khud ki batch bechna chahta h.
To ijat se bhech sala 247 ke alawa kya achive kiya h ye kabhi bataya nahi isne jaha jaao 2016 jee adv 247 😂😂😂 ke geet gata rehta h
60 minutes mein 45 questions vs 60 minutes mein 18 questions.
iit delhi se engineering kiya hai lekin engineer nahi hai...
Ye bkl hamesha bhokta hi rehta salla kute de dun kabhi sedhi nahi ho sakti gandu ko kitna bhi sam kha lo ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|53370)
Bhai ki puri life hi kuch logo se jada marks lana hai ek exam mei 🙏🗿
This guy's whole personality revolves around IIT delhi only even after so many years 😭😭😭
Placement nahi mila kya jo youtuber ban gaya 😭😭
Bhai ye banda iit delhi aur jee advanced se aage badha kaise nahi?, 9 saal baad bhi 17-18 saal vali mentality hai, bkl abhi bhi sochta hai ki 247 rank aai thi meri, Abey bsdk aayi *thi* thik hai na usme kya, uske baad koi achievement nahi hai kya teri.
abhi bhi 247 ko milk karta hai dalla ben ka l*da.
2016 AIR 1 ko bhul gaya inke chalte💀💀
Chhee bhai kya cringe aadmi hai, 2016 beete hue 9 saal hogaye, isko placement wagheira nahi lagi thi kya ???
Iske batchmates abhi serving govt or other companies or doing R&D, ye chutiya abhi bhi apne aap ko student soch raha hai, compete with ur peer not your juniors lmao.
personally 2016 ki physics bahut easy thi for me 
jisne bhi POM thermal wagera and niche topics kra wo acha score kr skta tha ( mera phy strongest h )

Asli Physics to 2022 mai aayi thi usne to maarke rkhdi (change my mind)

Ye bass ek qn ko leke milk krte rehte
Ye bkl humare coaching  ke branch se tha
If "Khudke muh miya mithhu" had an example
Bhai lekin isne fir college me kya kia?
Agar itna mahaan hai to research field me kyu ni Gaya, yaha yt pe kyu hagg ra hai?
247 k alawa bnde ki koi personality h bhi?
Har jaga yhi bolta rhta
Sir Mai toh commerce without maths hu 🥺🥺🥺
Unc pushing 30s still talking bout an exam he wrote 10 yrs ago.
My guy peaked in 2016 and still stretching it out

Thak gaya hu iski harkato se
Bhale hi meine 2 saal sirf bakar maari hai but meine kabhi apni ek achievement ko apni puri personality nahi banayi.
I learnt ki khud ko hamesha improve karna chahiye not just sticking to that one compliment/ achievement jo by now ab koi puchta bhi nhi.
Ask this motherfucker ki iski CGPA kitni thi and i swear many from any random nit of that same branch have scored more than him and have build themselves great apart of this shitty exam alone.
Bhai kya maza aayega agar koi jee advanced AIR 1 isko chutiya bol de kisi din lmao
mere bhai engineering or medical 2 alag field hoti h shayad se?
thoda tu bhi research karleta ki medical aur engineering ki physics ka level alag alag kyu hota tha 20 saalo se?
punchbag si toh shakal h iski
ahard paper mein rank laana aasaan hota hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
He is proud about a tough question that appeared in a JEE Advanced paper that IIT profs made.
Diabolical isnt it ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49466)
Masterstroke 🤬 masterbait 😀
Chal ab jaldi se bta Cytoplasm kya hota hai?
Ek toh ye bhn k loda jaha dikh jata h dimaag or khrab ho jata h...iski graduation ho chuki h pta fir bhi baar baar gand maraane IITdelhi pahunch jata h or bakchodi pelta h waha juniors k saath
yahi iski puri personality hai
he gave the exam as a 17 year old in exam hall in 6 hours..
Gand mara le jindal
Ye bkl har waqt IIT-D ka tshirt hi kyu pahna rahta hai
Is l*** ko kon samjaye ki jee advanced relative he.
Agar paper hard aya hoga to kam marks me bhi acchi rank a sakti he.
Aur 2027 ke orgasm vala question ke bare me usne sirf kaha ki ye question aya tha but kaha nhi ke mene ye solve kiya Nishant is too low for this.
isnt jindal right this time?
mr never taught any hard topic in the class ..
i have watched all his lectures?![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
No MR Sir roasted
Bhai I might get downvoted but maine uski live dekhi thi, aur gaand mai dum hona chahiye advance ke paper live solve karne ki.
Wait bc ye 2016 wala tha ?
Guys I want to know that what happened to that guy who had scored AIR 1 at 2016 jee advanced how much aura does that guy could have ?
(I Don't want to offened anyone )

Requesting Everyone to Tweet & Urge IIT Kanpur to Postpone JEE Advanced 2025
Hi everyone,

Given the current situation with increased tensions and security concerns in parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, and Kashmir due to Indo-Pak issues, many students in these areas are facing difficulties with travel, internet access, and overall mental stress.
This is a humble request to the JEE community—aspirants, parents, and educators—to come together and request IIT Kanpur to consider postponing JEE Advanced 2025.
Even a short postponement can make a huge difference for students in affected regions.
Please help by tweeting to @IITKanpur using hashtags like #PostponeJEEAdvanced and #FairChanceForAll.
Here's a sample tweet you can copy:

"Dear @IITKanpur, due to ongoing Indo-Pak tensions in Punjab, Rajasthan & Kashmir, students are under stress & face disruptions.
Kindly consider postponing #JEEAdvanced2025 for fairness & safety.
#PostponeJEEAdvanced"

Let’s stand together for a fair exam process.
Thanks for your support!

STOP SLAMMING PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP FOR COLLEGES
This is just a rant.
So Basically every College other than IIT's is slammed here and its okay i get you.
But if the person is seeking genuine help, why do you have to mention IITs.
If They would be getting IITs, they wouldn't be a reddit loser begging for recommendations for colleges.
Also There's this thing, slamming private for IITs which is very understandable, but why are people slammimg tier 3 for other tier 3 with blatant misinformation.
Ask them if this private college is good and they will go," Go to amity or Sharda at this point", like Hell naw, telling to choose sharda uni over VIT bhopal or SRM ghaziabad like seriously man, do you want me to believe this that sharda is better option than these colleges.
I get you, it might be your college so ur frustrated but don't take out your frustration with misinformation 

No choosing sharda uni over GL bajaj, vit b or srm ghz is not a better option in anyway (even when all tier 3 are more or less same)

Also the truth is only 20-30% of any private uni are who grab good placements if it is tier 3 no matter what it is.
I checked all the stats and lmao everyone have the average of same 5lpa more or less.
Saarw tier 3 ek jaise h so ek tier 3 ke liye ek ko gali dena band kro bhai ek 5lpa average wala college dusre 5lpa average wale college ko gali dere

Also sharda me itti bheed h isse me tier 3 ke bhi neeche rakhu 😭

If you are using your degree to prove your importance or to show you usability and capabilities then bro you have done nothing in your life.
Degree for which you took 5 years instead of 4 ?
Kon hai ye bhot dino se dekh rhi iske baare mai hi bol rha hai log iski ek video aayi thi samne badtameez sa lg rha tha
👀👀☕ Dilli pawar 👊💪
IIT ki degree ka fayda hi kya hua agar paise highschool students ko brainwash karke hi banane hai
6 cgpa par survive karke to is chutiye ko mili hai degree
don't ask a clown why he's a clown, ask yourself why you keep going to the circus and keep posting about that clown on this sub
Bhai agar degree ke 5 saal baad bhi tumhe apne pehchaan Banana ke liye tumarha college use karna pad rha hai then you are just shit
IITK ne bhi mujhe drop lene bol diya 🤡

"Not all fights are from Allen"

"Why all fights are from Allen"

Wut
title is the nightmare of a logical reasoning question
har jagah hoti h,

viral bs allen wali hoti h
kyuki mere coaching ke students mei common sense hai
"Allen, padhai ke saath bhi, padhai ke baad bhi"
just like not all muslims are terrorist but all terrorists are muslims
Cuz allen is the path to succsex
BITSAT level logical reasoning question op ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
tf are you trying to say retard  ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
Allen might just be \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*.
Dude you can't even speak English, are you really going to give neet/jee?
Mei bhi allen jata hu.
Yha pe toh usse term bhi mil chuka hai 'Allen fight'.
Apna title padh firse ek baar dhang se
Fights don't have a coaching
Bro gave hand job (feeling samajh gaye sab tho![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367))
allen has the most students and the most centres.
Bhai waha comptishun hi bohut ha especially in physich wallah section ma and in chezo sa fight motion ma ati
bruh the brain ain't braining what were you tryna say?
kyuki bhai offline mei bada naam hai maa baap ko lagta hai ki bc humaara baccha jisko 8vi ka guna bhaag nahi aata hai isko bhi iit nikalwa denge 2 lakh mein.
gareeb maa baap ko lagta hai ki bc humaara blademaar baccha allen jaake doctor banke aayega aur hume gareebi se nikaalega.
baccha ho jaata hai frustrate kyuki bio samajh aa rahi hai magar yaad nahi ho rahi chemistry na samajh aa rahi na solve ho rahi aur physics mei na yaad ho rahi na samajh aa rahi na solve ho rahi.
toh aadmi apna frustration nikaalne ke liye maar peet karne lag jaate hai
Sabse zyada bacche hai isliye bc
Kyunki allen wale itna mind-fuck ho jate hai, unhe stress kidhar toh nikalna hota hai, aur muth voh log maar nahi sakte(iykyk)
Same like not all muslims but why always muslim
Kyuki padhlo chaahe kahi pe maar peer hoga yahi pe

My brain is not braining.
I think you meant "not every Allen is fighting but it's always an Allen student fighting"
Bc...aaj bhi padhai ni ho payegi yeh adv ke admit card aur boards result ke chutiyape ke bich

More than 3 scoring 700+ in NEET'25
How come everyone is saying cutoff will be around 550 or something?
Ye kya ho rha hai???
3 of them are from Rajasthan, Bihar and West Bengal.
She is from Allen Kota ( achiever batch) and her classmates and friends from AIIMS Delhi has also confirmed this.
I'm so scared rn , idk what will happen to my future

lowkey clout chaser vibes
Maybe, it's just me but I find it hard to trust someone who writes 'vedio' instead of video../s
Doctor siblings toh yaad hi hoga aap sabko![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Isn't she the one who got her ass whooped by parents ?
Have y’all forgotten Ayushi Patel?
Girlie claimed to score 715 last year when her actual score was near 350.
When everyone is nervous about the result it’s easy for people to make faltu “vedio’s” like this to gain views out of your anxiety.
Don’t trust anyone but actual verified source.
Ye kya naya chutiyapa hai, pagal ho gyi hu main
I'm so done with this fucking shit
Just cause few people are getting above 700 doesn't mean the cutoff will go above 700 ...
It's definitely gonna stay below 550-560 



( Betting my left nut on this )
wait she the one who got her ass kicked by her parents??
Aunki Prep acchi hogi, they were maybe prepared for this.
Ho sakta he koi 720 wala pikachu bhi ajaye
Ab mujhe lag raha hai ki parents se pitayi bhi jhut hogi
Video koh vedio spell kara Hai idk then what to expect
But then why BM sir claiming that he hasn't heard any 700+ yet

Accha hai main Andha hun; Kya kya dekhna pd rha hai![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
Bata kitne paise diye usne channel promote karne ke![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49466)
Last year to 2000 baccho ke 700+ the na?
To is baar 3 baccho ke aa bhi gaye to kis baat ka rr
haan bhai

allen ke daddy zi ne bola srg se koi nahi hai jisne 700 + laya aur tu uspe bharosa mat kar , random onliners pe kar 

gajab hai
neet me promotion ki haalat bohot kharab hai.
influencer maxxing - mostly ye log already pichle saal bhi yt videos banate the - par channel hit nahi hua and all.
bhai isi ladki ke parents ne isko mara tha  ??
You're right I'm one of them and I got 719 marks.
1 marks deducted for bad handwriting
Dost kota nain hain neet ki prep kar rha haij.
Kahan hain allen ka malik ne khud kahan hain highest 680 gya hain.
Chill kar cutoff utna nahi jayga.
Aur 3 people 700+(thoda locha toh lag rha hain)
Giving srg secrets but can't even spell video properly🤦
I bet both my balls that the cutoff gonna stay below 550-60
One who spells "vedio" wants to write neet.
i highly doubt this is true i can’t lie
The fact that I won’t be getting 700 or plus so anyone who does Congratulations and pls give me free tuition 😭😭
Yaar tum log sab sach man lete ho kya ??
Bhai result ki wait kar sab clear hoga
but i guess most probably the cut off wont go that low...
jisne karna thha usne kar liya hoga acha khasha ..
panic karne wale hi yt pe hai iss time .....
highest marks of allen kota star batch of neet this year is 705 as far as I know
promotion krne ki ninja technique 😂
i know A GUY who is saying he will score 720![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
Some coachings just try to create panic among aspirants so they can sell their courses.
Even if we get selected, they’re not going to refund the fees.
guys trust me  
the exam after result was just the beginning  
the real deal will be the result when cutoffs wouldn't match difficulty level
Promotion krne ka tarika thodi kezual h
HOW HER PARENTS WHOOPED HER ASS CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME?
Neet didi bhaiya se dur hi raho to accha, jo hoga woh to result ke din hi hoga
Stop posting shitss aspirants are still traumatized we will get to know when results will be out and yes the same era is gonna repeat where u have to afford expensive coachings to clear papers ..It feels like a big game with aspirants
I came to know from my teacher that highest from aakash in india was about 695 or something.
So make of that what you will
Can I get a bds seat for 300???
Obviously there will be many droppers and mbbs cut off is 550 ish???
Is it possible for get a bds seat from government college???????
Isn't she the same person who got abused by her parents for not doing good enough in NEET?
Believe me when I say that nobody from Allen's Srg in Rajasthan is scoring 710+.
My friend who had neet this year was picked by Allen in class 10th and was studying in the srg batch that is not even mentioned in their chartlist.
So that's just shit and giggles just for clicks
bhai ye sab kya hai.
heart attack mat do, sab toh keh rahe the 650 below hogi cutoff
Mujhe yeh nai samjh aata what's this neet cutoff for?
can't even spell "video" ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49466)
Ab pata chala kyu piti thi
yeh schizophrenic hai bhai
I wouldn't make jokes about the abuse like some shitheads in the comments but that's some attention seeking behavior lowkey
secrets in the "vedio"
Btw, the only reason she is popular, is because someone on this sub posted a video of her, and people started to pity subscribing to her....
Neet ke garam mahol me views lele gi fir rakshita singh ban jayegi
channel desc looks like smthn chatgpt whipped up.
Is chomu ki baat mat masn simp saale 🤣🫵🏻
allen ke malik ne bola tha 600+ 106 bachhe hain...
sahi piti thi ye
no way, unreal stats
2016 mein bhi nahi hua tha yeh to and that was easier than 2025
I am done for
ye Saab bakchodi karoge toh MAA BAAP marenge 🥀🤡, like dude phele pitne or emotional damage ka "vedio" banao phir , subs gain karke click and rage bait banao .
Comments mein dekho bohot sare yt vids ke saab SRG wale hai COPE kar rahe hai .
Sab fake he, did not heard 700+ anywhere in 2025
Cutoff will be in 450-500 range (Ive asked many people's score)
Gharwalo ne pitai ki thi na iski?
Fir bhi nhi Maan rhi
"vedio" 😭 bro how can we trust her
"vedio" 😭 bro how can we trust her

r/ihadastroke

what is the first sentence supposed to mean?
cbse tougher than adv, neet tougher than adv?
the fuck is this shitshow
telangana board has easiest board exams  
all of us (my friends) studied a day before the exam and scored 97%💀
Yes telengana boards are easy asf same question repeats Every year with same values and someone could easily score 99%only 2 marks u would loose due to 1 mark In language and english the language is easy asf same as class 10 hindi and sanskrit
Was it really harder than advanced or am I too smart or too dumb??
Which one is correct
HSC would like to say hello!
Bro, if that paper was harder than advanced, I'd be sitting here with IIT guaranteed, but I'm not lol.
Easy tough ka to pata nahi but worst sabse Maharashtra Board hai 👍  
kabhi bhi mat lena koi 👍
Tum logo ne jee advanced ka paper aaj tak khola bhi hai??.
Like jee advanced ka easiest question aaya tha board mai wo bhi optional mai tab tum itna zyada roone lag gye the .
Beta ek baar khol lena jee advanced actual toughness pata lag jayegi..
Mene issi saal diya tha cbse board isliye I am eligible to write this
Telangana friend is the easiest board ever - you just have to memorize a set question bank and questions always repeat from those.
Telangana board is swarmed with proxy colleges like narayana, chaitanya who use residential coaching classes.
And amount of cheating and leaks goes under the rug.
Any noob can get 80+ in their intermediate boards.
well obviously jee adv is far harder than CBSE boards  
but telangana's board exam are EASY AFFFFF.
i have a friend of mine who score 94% in boards and 18%ile in jee mains  
question paper bas repeated questions aate hai(sometimes, values dont even cchange) and idhar ke schools bachho ko saare pyqs rattwate hai.
so they eaily score 95% + in their boards.
mai bhi telangana ka hu but i went to a cbse school.
so when my results come, they gonna cope and compare themselves to me.
in no way was the cbse paper tougher than adv, as someone who had the Delhi set.
OP seems to be one  of the people who failed in the TS board
if cbse is the toughest board exam then harsh sir(vedantu) is my mentor ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
cbse ki marking achi hoti h
sane for maharashtra board bro .
it's not hard the , paper checkers are high one something
It also depends on way of checking, for example, in gujrat board, there is a 'rule' that you can't get 95+ in language subjects, like writting skills me sab kuch perfect hua, toh bhi har question me se 1 marks to kat hi lete hai sale, tabhi to state topper ke bhi kabhi 97 ke upar nahi jate hai
If cbse board is harder than JEE ADV, then I'm aleecc daddy
Bhai Iss saal sabke fatt ke hath me ani wali hai kyu?
kyu ki ye log points se marks system banaye hai so before it was like 80-100 was 10 points so it was very easy I agree and practical ke marks tho we know right schools give em for free.
This time there are no practicals too.
Yaar nazar lag gaya hai yaar
this time correction was strict asf icl .
adv ka aa jata na toh mein bohot jyada hi cooked hota aint no way adv level tha.![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49464)
I think it was tougher than mains but nowhere near advanced...
I did find phys and chem board kinda hard
Yes yes yes yes, this is the one thing that surprised me soo much when I took state board in class 11(FIITJEE wanted to make students' life easier and I can't thank them enough for this).
Bihar board enters the chat ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49464)
Bhai as a stateboard victim, yaha papers bohtttt easy hote hai as compared to cbse but itna ghatiya checking hota hai ki 85+ laane walo ko 70-75 milta hai🤦‍♂️
Seems like you're also from Telangana Board

https://preview.redd.it/0kvjn0c7d30f1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27c4d7a2c331bd22fe37bb3d884efd5542fabe02
Bhai log jo bhi kar nahi sakta wo hi ADV se tough hota hai kya bc, matlab adv ko boogeyman baja diya bhadwo ne.
people tend to overrate the difficulty of board exams.
It's tougher than mains, but saying it's tougher than jee adv is delulu.
There is a huge luck factor in telengana board as somebody that studied in it some of my friends attempted for 80-85 in Sanskrit and still landed 99 while some despite attempting everything perfectly don't get 99 personally my math paper went really good but still for no goddamn reason the evaluator circled some places like they were wrong even though they were right and cut marks for me instead of getting 70+/75 I ended up with 53 and re-evaluation is also a bullshit process no matter how many mistakes were done in evaluating a question once evaluated there won't be re-evaluation even if u submit your papers for re-evaluation they just do totalling again and check if the first time around any questions were missed from evaluation and add marks but won't change the correction no matter how many mistakes were commited by the original evaluator and english correction is also bullshit they cut marks for shit like not putting commas full stops and capital letters they literally don't read the answer they just look for these mistakes and start cutting marks in french there is a good percentage of teachers that believe the evaluators don't know french because in both my years i bullshitted through the paper and landed 70 without knowing even a bit of french so yes if u are lucky good if you aren't you are fucked but if you are like really good in studies u aren't fucked and will get away
Bhai ye advanced ka level itna gir gya he kya ?
Bc result kab aayega cbse ka 😭 darr lag rha hai aurwo chutiye result he nhi de rhe
Students failing state board exams boil down to extremely poor quality of primary and secondary education in government schools.
You can't crack even the easiest of exams without proper reading comprehension and  basic writing and arithmetic ability which these students lack.
Chu hai kya bhai CBSE sala mere gujarat board se zyada easy hai, 30 marks hai practicals ke aur mere board me 100 marks ka pura paper hota hai, usme 50 MCQ FOR 1 HR + 50 Theory.
And to get admission in gujrat institutes we have to get a good score in GUJCET.
and if you compare with adv, we are no where in front of it.
Tamil Nadu: ayy welcome to my team!
tougher than adv my ass
The easiest exam is the one that let whomever wrote this meme pass English
Should've switched to telangana board myself but here I am
ya, I have given boards (ts) in 11th, so I can say it's easier than cbse but bhot rattna padhta hai, like agar tum mistake karte ho likhne mein then they cut marks (cbse correction is bit easier than ts boards)

my friend went for re evaluation, just 2 chemistry questions he wrote on his own words but still contained important terms, still they cut 4 marks (out of 8 it was 2 questions of 4 marks each).
Also in cbse only you write boards once (12th), but in ts board you'll have to write twice (11th and 12th and total marks will be displayed in final result).
Sanskrit is hard in ts board like literally bhot rattna padhta hai, but cbse ki Sanskrit easy hoti hai, mene try Kiya hai.
So, bas ts board languages mein and evaluation mein thoda sa hard hai, baki cbse se easy hi hai
Nah bro i agree.
Telangana state boards are easy af.
And when I say easy, I mean it.
The exams are rigged, yk what questions will show up in the paper.
I prepared like one day before the paper and somehow managed to score 97.9% and for context, my mains result was 96.5.
Even lord basava scored 55% in these.
Also CBSE tougher than adv?
What's with this new propaganda by CBSE and neetards?
kaun hai yeh chutiye joh cbse aur neet ko adv se tough keh rhe hai?
matlab free will hai toh kuch bhi?
Ppl telling this yr neet diff than adv, bro just see adv paper before speaking
Kya hi cope karte hai yeh log??
Tougher than adv lmao
HSC Boards results were TRASH
"tougher than adv" bol dete ho lol.
Ek baar paper do adv ka pta lagega
Inn mdrchdo ne kabhi adv ka paper dekha bhi hai?
Har cheez ko adv se "tougher" bna rahe hai bsdk😭🙏🏻
CBSE being tougher than JEE Advanced is some advanced delulu glazing.
Advanced can have the first ranker at less than 50%, CBSE will fail you if you do that.
On the other hand, in my Telangana Board Exam, the guy next to me broke down and the teacher consoled him and told him to copy from me.
Thankfully I was writing a different exam so they made him sit elsewhere to copy from someone else.
Fucker did copy my English exam the next day though.
I have no respect for people who can't pass an exam they already have the answers to.
I had to barely prep for it since we had a week or 2 to prepare, but the questions came as is, so fucking dumb.
Clear op has kept the honor of cbse..
By giving doggy style to English.
I mean what the fuck does the first sentence mean?
Clear op has kept the honor of cbse..
By giving doggy style to English.
I mean what the fuck does the first sentence mean?
the thing is CBSE m kuch bhi subject related likh do marks miljayenge but that's not the case for telangana state board, separate books hote h jiss se padke likhna h basically ratta marna iss saal tho questions came out of the gunshot questions
our teacher says that cbse is easiest board.
CBSE boards is not that easy , however its nowhere near even mains level let alone advanced lmfao
TOUGHER THAN JEE ADV???
☹️🙏 one of my friend is from Telangana board 
Commerce student without maths 
☹️💔she got 96% in her 12th 
(She is literally a pookie a good human being bhai I'm not defaming her I love her sm I'm not even doing some backbitching 
I'm happy for my friend but all she did was talk to the guys and she still was able to score 96%) 
It jus hurt sm bhai yha ghiste ghiste mrte h pir jaake 85+ bnti h 
Bs thoda bura lgta h 
But it's okay vo bhi toh apni hi dost h
If one only prepares 5yrs PYQs he'll get 95+% marks !!!
Chup gandu mc saale cbse tougher than jee adv cbse is easier than state boards like MH TN etc
Telangana board exam paper is easy as fuck.
Noob papers in all subjects, especially in sanskrit.
My sanskrit teacher just gave us 18 pages worth of questions and answers.
I just read that and got 99/100 in sanskrit lol.
A page takes like ten minutes to learn.
Telengana board paper - 🤡
Telengana board checking - 💀
⚠️⚠️⚠️Read this first ⚠️⚠️⚠️

As a Telangana student....
This year was a mishap..
Especially with the subject 2B i have personally checked the question paper with LMR/ other revision books
Which we usually depens on since they always work


And guess what

2LAQ
2SAQ

Yes, only those many questions and a nail in the coffin was that those questions aren't even from gunshot related(like those for sure to come type)

If we knew like this would have happened we would have studied the concept and learnt the lesson

But we also thought they would max give from previous papers which was true for our seniors and all but yeah we got screwed due to sudden change in paper


Yes you are right, the paper is easy but we were fixated in our mind that only previous paper questions will come thanks to clg, parents and tutors
And the sudden change screwed us up


Oh and a nail nail in the coffin they do check papers very thoroughly
75% KI CHINTA ANDAR HI ANDAR KHAYEE JA RAHI HAI😭

My Success Story: From a jee failure to success in life

I failed jee miserably but then my real comeback happened because of my hardwork.

This amount of money motivated me,I then made a 2016 rotational motion question edit which won "JEE porn of the year award",all 26tards and 27tards fapped on that edit.
Then I started making laser eye edits of alecc daddy and anup daddy,I also made joker edits of MR sir.
I also proved my teachers wrong: saalo ki akad tod di maine,mujhe chutiya samajhte the,I was the sigma dank memer of my classroom.
Because of sheer hardwork and dedication,today I am a proud moderator of 3 subreddits and owner of an iitjee hookah bar edits youtube channel with 38 subscribers.

Obc are more in number than general canditates and still have reservations.
So general canditates are a minority and also have no privileges
This happens in every exam.
Sad to say but yeah the seats available for general are not "reserved" for the general.
It is open for all.
Its similar to like Home state quota in NITs..
50% seats are reserved for HS..
but among the remaining 50%..
both Home state and other states students are taken.
So it's not like every NIT is having exactly 50% students from other states
Cool you guys keep wasting you time and mental peace on this and it keeps getting easier for me to get the hell out of this country asap
https://preview.redd.it/fm2j1hb8450f1.jpeg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce20e83b829a20f858e3a6eb29ed8e74aa87061a

Everywhere, General seats are considered as "Unreserved"
bhai isi reason ki wajah se reservation is a bad thing 

agar general wale seats sirf general ko hote toh won't that be called a reservation for generals

people in the comments acting shocked and the funny thing is they were complaining against the system just because other people did
This happens in all exam in india.
The 40%% is of open category, .
If a SC student score 99%tile then he will take  admission in a nit from open category  🤡🤡🥲
Behenchod 😭 aisa hota hai kya
Apply for RTI to the concerned authorities to know how many person who have reservation and got the seat which is in general category, you'll find out that barely anyone have got seat of general cz reserve category guys barely have concerned rank to get the seat in general quota.
BRO WHAT THE FUCK
Good Morning bro har jageh aisa hi hota hai for gen seats all are eligible ( India mai gen middle class male chodke sabke liye reservation hai)
This country will give you more reasons to leave it
*this* is specifically what im against, not reservation in general.
we general category are the minority who are getting discriminated against.Its been 75 years+
Why do these category people even exist
Ye kya bhakchodi hai
Btw Exam konsa h ????
Ye to hota hi hai.
UPSC CSE 2018 topper Kanishak Kataria is an example.
General r not let to hv exams to get seats but just to squeeze out double the fees amount nd then blame themselves for their failure with 90+%ile, while ppl with 47%ile make college plans
This is normal, first the general seats are filled and and it has everything general obc sc st pwd, then the caste base take place.
Otherwise the cutoffs would've been much lower if this wasn't the case
Bro General means simply Unreserved seats.
If a person of a reserved category secures a rank well enough to get the unreserved seat, he will get the seat under the unreserved pool.
There's nothing new in this.
This literally happens in most of the major national level competitive exams in India especially the government ones 🤷🏻‍♀️
This is true for every exam.
This is how reservation works.
Every reserved person can claim general seat in every exam.
If u see clearly, It is not ***General,*** *i*t's ***Unreserved*** which means not reserved for anyone, open to everyone.
Exactly this should be the actual norm but very rarely followed in any institutions!
Like reserved category guy should go through CR list first...
Site inki chalti nhi.
Traffic inse manage hota nhi.

Those who are saying ki nta toh fir bhi theek tha.........
Bro , insaan ki value samay nikalne ke baad hi hoti hai...
Nta ko bahut gaali diye thay na...
Anyone else who is just numb ?
So , here I am , a neet dropper , when I stand on the roof i think if taking drop from there will be a successful attempt or failed one , i try to analyse the possibilities.
I know this is normal for aspirants, right ?
I was once a person who loved height coz I loved watchi world from up above but now I don't even remember looking at the world , my brain just looks down to analyse the height and it's impact lol.
By all the taunts , the failures , I have become so numb, that now I don't even know what I feel.
I was a very sensitive child , well a teen too , then neet happened, now even if sometim (mistakenly) I want to cry , there's no tears lol , it's like I don't even want to cry.
I came here to vent but I have a lot on my mind but nothing to say , relatable?
Today is my birthday and I don't feel shit , I am just neutral and mind you once I used to be so excited about my birthday ( not because of my family but because I personally loved celebrating B'days even if it's mine).
I want to move on past this neet phase , I don't want to do this , but my parents are stuck on this , their words "bnna to tumhe doctor hi hai" lol.
Anyways , i hope y'all find your peace.

Happy birthday bro to you and to me don't feel sad becoz I've been ignoring my birthday since 2 years last year when my ppr didn't go well I didn't celebrate but this time no matter what i will celebrate because neet can come again but you at this age won't
Happy birthday mere pyare bhai/behen.
Rishte daron ko paani mein fek 
Goli maar khush reh 
Chinta mt kar
Bhai bhai, happy birthday.
There’s much more to life than being a doctor.
Maybe your parents don’t realise it, but there is sooo much to do in life.
This year’s exam was shitty, and it was shitty for everyone.
Please don’t blame yourself for it.
Parents don’t get that that this year’s paper was genuinely nothing that aspirants have seen before.
This time will pass too, love <3
happy birthday brother 🎉....just stop wanting validation...it will work out....I tried this personally...
it's hard...but it gives yourself enough space to live....
Don't worry bro, Me also numb 
Dm karde bhai
Yes....it does take a lot....no matter what they say....we are courageous....we dedicated more than a year just for our dreams....and we tried.
Trust me buddy....it really isn't easy....I mean there are tonnes of chances where it seems so easy to end up ur life and be done with it once and for all....but then the faces of those come up ....our parents....ik you feel like u disappointed them....but babe....
Failing and trying and again failing and trying?
Maybe we will succeed one day.....not here but somewhere else.
Be strong.....and happy birthday.
Stay safe and take care of yourself....
You're More than you think 🥀✨
Honestly you just spoke out the true words of almost all neet aspirants 

Convince your parents if you aren't really interested in neet or becoming a doctor 

Paisa kahi se bhi bana loge it doesn't really mean u have to take mbbs etc 

Nonetheless happy birthday fellow neet mate 

All the best for your future days have a great life ahead brother/sister
Iit Kanpur aisa mat kro😭😭😭

Thanks Alecc daddy for saving my JEE prep
I cheated on allen
Pw is really good in it's content and teachers
Tum log PW ko underestimate kr rhe ho.
Maa chudegi very soon
Honestly this felt easier than 2024.
Surprisingly I could barely remember any questions despite having done pyqs over the last 2 years, which is why I am extra pleased with my score.
I only remembered the chimney problem and one electrostatics sum so to make it fair i decided to skip those questions.
Everything else felt new.
Time management in paper 1 needed some work.
Itni rank ke around actual exam me aa jaye to me party dunga.

real exam me ek to anxiety aur dusra pressure rahta hai.
qn lagte hai ban jaayenge par bante nahi.
I gave advanced last year utna acha nahi hua phir iss saal de raha hu.
time ka dikkat unko hota hai jinko saara sawaal banana hai(imo) par qn samjh hi nahi aaye ya proceed kaise karna hai wahi na samjh aaye to kya karoge.....
Congrats bro, crazy score
Me too gave yesterday,   
P1: P-35 C-20 M-33 (88)  
P2: P-27 C-24 M-37 (88)  
 176/360   
P: 62/120(I am TERRIBLE at physics, so ig 2023 was easy)  
C: 44/120(Nothing surprising)  
M: 70/120( found it tougher, i usually score 80+ in maths).
Konse website se di?
crazy bhai, mere to 106 ban rahe sirf vo bhi 2024 waale me 😭
I gave it today and only managed 61 and 78 💀 In paper 1, I had to skip section 1 and 2 of physics due to my terrible time management.
Paper 2 I managed to go through most but still.
Some questions were left unread.
Can you give me tips on how to improve
nice bro bdiyaa ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)
Bhai kaunsi website hai??
Bhai aaj allen ka mock diya 98 aaye 😭😭😭
i also want to attempt in the same way
I also had time management issues, corrected them by thinking I only had to do some questions and not all, so I firstly solved the questions of only those chapters in which I was confident(Calc in math, mechanics in physics, organic in chem) and then moved on to the others, it's satisfying when you know you're done with what you're good at
Maine 3 mahine pehle diya tha

p1: 34/6/39 

p2: 37/7/38 (w/ physics bonus)
same feeling, felt easier than 2024, mere isme 182 aaye aur 2024 mek 141 🥲
mera 2021 me 175 bn paya tha but still exam me hugdunga
Ayjr ke liye sabhi ko best of luck

Help this Failed Jeetard, NTA cancelled the postponing of CUET for Border Region Students without even releasing any official notification.
NTA ne kal ek notification nikali thi that CUET exams from 13-16 of these regions(jammu, kashmir and some other border areas) are getting postponed humare admit card pe bhi yahi likha tha aur ab suddenly chupke se unhone wo notification hata di aur admit card wali website me border areas wale students ke admit card change kar diye aur kitne to bachhon ko pata bhi ni chalega ki admit card change hue hai, kaafi to abhi bhi yahi soch re honge ki mere admit card pe likha hai ki exam postponed hai.
(Infact muje bhi kuch time pehle tak yahi lag ra tha wo to kisi ne bataya muje)
           
NTA should stay with their original notification to reduce the confusion among students not to mention the blackouts, shelling and drone attacks going for past 5 days was hell, no one was able to study a bit in them.
Why should border areas students suffer man??
If any of you are on Twitter (X) please retweet this https://x.com/ekManu_/status/1921642978474352712?t=zvbGh1qk0jqb0f8f7-ztuQ&s=19 .
Your contribution to take this issue to the officials would be much appreciated.
BTW comedk, which is an entrance exam for universities of Karnataka also postponed exams for students of border areas IDK why an entrance exam for nation wide colleges cannot do the same.

What in the yt short ass fuck is this shi bhai, reddit ko bhi yt bna rhe saale cringe se 15y/os,😭😭
**COMPETITIVE**  exams are meant to be tough
NTA did what they had to, stop being a bitch about it.....agar easy paper hota toh 710 pe bhi lund na milta tabb bhi rote baith te.....kisne kaha tha physics ratne ko?
Jee ke papers as mocks de rhe the, practice toh ho hi chuki hogi na lmao
abe agr 2016 me adv n neet dono hard aye the 

 toh 2025 me usse bhi tough ayenge???
BOTH neet n adv

IIT at 13% score)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)
More harder nhi hota.
YE BKL ARPIN PALA HAR JAGAH DIKH JATA H
Damn itna cringe gaana😂😭
Cut off will also be lower!
Why are you guys forgetting about this
tough exams are good if you prepared seriously enough cuz it litreally eliminates a lot of competition
Chutiye last year 720 wale ko v AIIMS DELHI nahi mil rha thaa.
Easy paper apne gand mei daal le.
Competitive exams are meant to be tough, such that they can be fair towards those who work hard and put efforts in concepts.
Mere Mitra paper hard /tough kuch nahi hota .apan mehnat hi easy way wali karte hai ....Mere Mitra work at your insanity, the hardest of hard will become easy-pisy for you

Jojoa bizarre adventures 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Grave of the fireflies
Haikyuu , aot , apothecary diaries...well and many more!
AOT is the only correct answer
Fate (SN+ZERO+UBW+HF+APOCRYPHA+GRACE NOTES+FGO: FO + BABYLONIA+ CAMELOT+ SOLOMON), Hellsing, Garden of Sinners and Bleach

https://i.redd.it/3w7jhrnkn40f1.gif
Apothecary diaries,
Made in abyss, shiki,
attack on titan 

only anime that I have watched , but it was better than any movie or series I watched .
hit monke , elvish, altered carbon reesleeved , xmen 95
Kingdom ki manga padh goated h
My firt Anime was Demon slayer and the animation is just so fucking good toll now it was my favourite but then I watched AOT and no anime can steal AOT's spot of being the best anime.
I have watched, jjk, Solo leveling, Dan da dan, Kaiju no.
But AOT tops this list and then the fight scenes of demon slayer!!!
Not a NEETard but Code Geass
I've watched tons of anime but never anything surpassed the feeling death note and aot had unleashed upon me

The favorite manga would be twentieth century boys
Bongou stray dogs (jk its Monster and Aot, but bsd is good as well)
Full metal Alchemist brotherhood
Jojo’s bizzare adventure, one piece, bleach, and many more

Kimi no nawa (Your Name)
My first anime✨✨
redo of healer , goblin no suna, night shift nurse, kuro no kyoushitou, shokuzai no kyoushitsu
Its not peak but fun as hell
Back in 2016-17 when anime still used to air in Indian television, i watched Golden Time, one of my first anime (excluding shinchan and doraemon).
For me its the best anime, mainly due to nostalgia.
The apothecary diaries - best anime of this season imo.
Not the best of all time but yeah

![gif](giphy|3Wj1SxyDEznCjXiMtm|downsized)
Started frieren and ngl it's pretty good
Hard to choose a favourite though
https://preview.redd.it/lff46qsfr50f1.jpeg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8842eca1bf73aebefe199ec4bb693099f45ec8b3

Evangelion comes a close second
Aot , Vinland saga, berserk , blue lock, monster , hajime no ippo, death note , coe, spirited away , your name , dr stone![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49455)

HxH
Jujutsu Kaisen
Death note

but give up ho raha hai lyf me 💔
Season 3 toh patani kaha gand marva ra .
AOT and one piece
https://preview.redd.it/ghft4k0an50f1.jpeg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4539b3794fcd606f6e45ef87eb584c39e6db9cd

I don't know if anyone has watched this or not, but it's called Claymore and is one of the finest animes ever
Probably like AOT or something idk
Gintama- the best anime for people suffering from depression
Gintama
Code Geass 
Steins Gate
Monster
Aot
Konosubha
Re Zero
One piece(if possible)
RE ZERO IS LOVE
Oregairu - absolute cinema teenage experience
Serial experiments lain

https://preview.redd.it/2rm9ftwpz50f1.png?width=258&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f9ccbc8b2b57cf331751c42d7111075222306e
VINLAND SAGA
 it will teach you alot about life
One Punch Man + Aot
Honestly, If you (not op) are new to anime just watch frieren, Dandadan, Naruto, Death Note, Love is war, Noragami and Dungeon Meshi are good starts 

For connoisseurs, Shame on you for not being able to navigate the anime world and find the gems!!
(Jk, but i really need a recommendation first before i recommendat)

Watch Hellsing ultimate for shounen
Beyond the boundary 
Kafi badhiya hai
Re:Zero all day anyday 🔥🔥🔥
black clover is nice one.
Berserk manga

Anime me- baki, grand blue, AOT, deathnote
Reverend insanity ( not the cringe part)
Wdym "your" did you make it?
86, Kaguya Sama, Your lie in April, Fruit basket, Flavours of youth, A silent voice, 5 centimetres per second (i loovveeee this), ToraDora, Skip and Loafer(So casual, So pleasant), Hyouka, GoSick (both of them are top tier imo)

Also there's JoJos, Black Clover too but they are longer but equally worth it
Wild take but detective Conan?
Depends on genre, 

Action/Adventure: One Piece, AOT

Thriller: Death Note

Rom-com: Horimiya and Kaguya-sama

Sports: Blue Lock (Although I read the manga only)

Slice of Life: Sakamoto Days

I know these are generic but its is what it is.
Honorable mentions: Bleach, HxH, Black Clover, Haikyuu, SL
Hajime no ippo really good
Monster 20th century boys supremacy ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)
A true warrior dosen't need a sword🗣️🙌
Days with my stepsis
Your lie in April
Deathnote(not new to anime)
It's a very sensitive anime with sensitive topics involved but a great watch nonetheless.
Death Note(Light supporter) and AOT(after Season 4 ka war wala theme jab shuru hua)
code geass is the best anime


fight me
Stein gate , Aot ,
i can do anything to forget it and rewatch it again
Parasyte and Chainsaw man
Monster...no one even comes close
Hellsing Ultimate masterpiece u aren't gonna regret a second watching it
Without a doubt AOT
Your name (it's a movie)
!RemindMe 1 year

Hopefully I survive 1st year
AOT and One piece
Attack on Neet Aspirants 2025 is definitely the Way to Go!
Shiki, aot, promised Neverland
One piece for me but cowboy bebop or Made in Abyss are lengdary
I choose Monster then
Vinland Saga ong Thorfinn is me fr
Evangelion and rezero for me

Help this Failed Jeetard, NTA cancelled the postponing of CUET for Border Region Students without even releasing any official notification.
NTA ne kal ek notification nikali thi that CUET exams from 13-16 of these regions(jammu, kashmir and some other border areas) are getting postponed humare admit card pe bhi yahi likha tha aur ab suddenly chupke se unhone wo notification hata di aur admit card wali website me border areas wale students ke admit card change kar diye aur kitne to bachhon ko pata bhi ni chalega ki admit card change hue hai, kaafi to abhi bhi yahi soch re honge ki mere admit card pe likha hai ki exam postponed hai.
(Infact muje bhi kuch time pehle tak yahi lag ra tha wo to kisi ne bataya muje)
           
NTA should stay with their original notification to reduce the confusion among students not to mention the blackouts, shelling and drone attacks going for past 5 days was hell, no one was able to study a bit in them.
Why should border areas students suffer man??
If any of you are on Twitter (X) please retweet this https://x.com/ekManu_/status/1921642978474352712?t=zvbGh1qk0jqb0f8f7-ztuQ&s=19 .
Your contribution to take this issue to the officials would be much appreciated.
BTW comedk, which is an entrance exam for universities of Karnataka also postponed exams for students of border areas IDK why an entrance exam for nation wide colleges cannot do the same.

**COMPETITIVE**  exams are meant to be tough

tough exams are good if you prepared seriously enough cuz it litreally eliminates a lot of competition
Chutiye last year 720 wale ko v AIIMS DELHI nahi mil rha thaa.
Easy paper apne gand mei daal le.
Competitive exams are meant to be tough, such that they can be fair towards those who work hard and put efforts in concepts.
Mere Mitra paper hard /tough kuch nahi hota .apan mehnat hi easy way wali karte hai ....Mere Mitra work at your insanity, the hardest of hard will become easy-pisy for you

Def one is AOT
The good ones I've watched (not in any order)

Action 

1.
Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood
3.
Hunter x hunter
6.
Haikyuu (not action but SS tier)
7.
Steins gate (not action but SS tier)
9.
Eminence in shadow
12.
Solo leveling

Romance

Alya hides her feelings in russian
5.
Bunny girl senpai
7.
Crush at work
8.
Sign of affection
10.
Angel next door spoils me rotten
13.
My happy marriage

Peak animes yet to watch

1.
Gintama (currently watching)
2.
Ginatama is the best anime ever made
i don't watch anime that much but HxH is my fav so far
one piece,
vagabond ,
berserk,
bleach,
vinland saga, aur bhi h pr yaad nhi ab
AOT BEKAR LAGA
3 way tie between Frieren, AoT and Dr Stone, If I had to rank them then AoT>Frieren>DrStone
Jojoa bizarre adventures 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Grave of the fireflies
Haikyuu , aot , apothecary diaries...well and many more!
AOT is the only correct answer
Fate (SN+ZERO+UBW+HF+APOCRYPHA+GRACE NOTES+FGO: FO + BABYLONIA+ CAMELOT+ SOLOMON), Hellsing, Garden of Sinners and Bleach

https://i.redd.it/3w7jhrnkn40f1.gif
Apothecary diaries,
Made in abyss, shiki,
attack on titan 

only anime that I have watched , but it was better than any movie or series I watched .
hit monke , elvish, altered carbon reesleeved , xmen 95
Kingdom ki manga padh goated h
My firt Anime was Demon slayer and the animation is just so fucking good toll now it was my favourite but then I watched AOT and no anime can steal AOT's spot of being the best anime.
I have watched, jjk, Solo leveling, Dan da dan, Kaiju no.
But AOT tops this list and then the fight scenes of demon slayer!!!
Not a NEETard but Code Geass
I've watched tons of anime but never anything surpassed the feeling death note and aot had unleashed upon me

The favorite manga would be twentieth century boys
Bongou stray dogs (jk its Monster and Aot, but bsd is good as well)
Full metal Alchemist brotherhood
Jojo’s bizzare adventure, one piece, bleach, and many more

i left watching anime after class 10 because there just wasn't any better one to watch than this masterpiece
Kimi no nawa (Your Name)
My first anime✨✨
redo of healer , goblin no suna, night shift nurse, kuro no kyoushitou, shokuzai no kyoushitsu
Its not peak but fun as hell
Back in 2016-17 when anime still used to air in Indian television, i watched Golden Time, one of my first anime (excluding shinchan and doraemon).
For me its the best anime, mainly due to nostalgia.
The apothecary diaries - best anime of this season imo.
Not the best of all time but yeah

What if I tell you that light yagami and SpongeBob have the same outfit

![gif](giphy|nDSlfqf0gn5g4)
fate watched recently thats why
for now hunterxhunter and dragon ball z
I have watched more than 300, and AOT and March comes like like a lion are in the top 5

Probably like AOT or something idk

Gintama
Code Geass 
Steins Gate

VINLAND SAGA
 it will teach you alot about life
One Punch Man + Aot
Honestly, If you (not op) are new to anime just watch frieren, Dandadan, Naruto, Death Note, Love is war, Noragami and Dungeon Meshi are good starts 

For connoisseurs, Shame on you for not being able to navigate the anime world and find the gems!!
(Jk, but i really need a recommendation first before i recommendat)

Watch Hellsing ultimate for shounen
Beyond the boundary 
Kafi badhiya hai
Re:Zero all day anyday 🔥🔥🔥
black clover is nice one.
Berserk manga

Anime me- baki, grand blue, AOT, deathnote
Reverend insanity ( not the cringe part)
Wdym "your" did you make it?
86, Kaguya Sama, Your lie in April, Fruit basket, Flavours of youth, A silent voice, 5 centimetres per second (i loovveeee this), ToraDora, Skip and Loafer(So casual, So pleasant), Hyouka, GoSick (both of them are top tier imo)

Also there's JoJos, Black Clover too but they are longer but equally worth it
Wild take but detective Conan?
Depends on genre, 

Action/Adventure: One Piece, AOT

Thriller: Death Note

Rom-com: Horimiya and Kaguya-sama

Sports: Blue Lock (Although I read the manga only)

Slice of Life: Sakamoto Days

I know these are generic but its is what it is.
Honorable mentions: Bleach, HxH, Black Clover, Haikyuu, SL
Hajime no ippo really good
Monster 20th century boys supremacy ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)
A true warrior dosen't need a sword🗣️🙌
Days with my stepsis
Your lie in April
Deathnote(not new to anime)
It's a very sensitive anime with sensitive topics involved but a great watch nonetheless.
Death Note(Light supporter) and AOT(after Season 4 ka war wala theme jab shuru hua)
code geass is the best anime


fight me
Stein gate , Aot ,
i can do anything to forget it and rewatch it again
Parasyte and Chainsaw man
Monster...no one even comes close
Hellsing Ultimate masterpiece u aren't gonna regret a second watching it
Without a doubt AOT
Your name (it's a movie)
!RemindMe 1 year

Hopefully I survive 1st year
AOT and One piece
Attack on Neet Aspirants 2025 is definitely the Way to Go!
Shiki, aot, promised Neverland
One piece for me but cowboy bebop or Made in Abyss are lengdary
I choose Monster then
Vinland Saga ong Thorfinn is me fr
Evangelion and rezero for me
bhai bl bta du ?
Orb: Around the movement of earth

Which software for color grading and effects
First picture looks like it's from cyberpunk 2077 gameplay..
Photos badhiya hai, color correction thoda better hosakta hai.
Jo tumne color correction ki hai wo serious aur gloomy vibe derha hai, kuch photos pe wo match karhe toh kuch pe nahi.
Baki all the best, android phone me limited kaam hi hosakta hai.
it's so good that it's looks like ai

I've been trying to capture neo noir like in the first pic but alas.

Photography and editing skills both are really good 👍
Dayum looks like a movie
I literally thought the first pic looked like a screenshot from cyberpunk 2077

advanced admit card and mail
is the admit card page opening for anyone?
because when i enter the required details, the page loads and then comes back to the infilled format.
also did anyone get a confirmation mail after the registration?
as in after you guys filled the form, there must have been an auto generated mail and only after the fee payments, would you guys have gotten that registration page which has the registration number and all other details.
did anyone get a proper submission email after that?

Thing is, if you enter any wrong detail it gives you error, and if you enter everything right, if you notice, the link changes, so I think they messed up the smth in the coding and all, they will probably fix it cuz we cant access admit cards obviously
Bhai mera admit card download hi nhi ho rha, admit card wala link hi  nhi khul raha

Sports at higher level are as competitive as these exams get.
Abhi bhi time hai you can work for it and achieve it
SAME 😭 , I trained badminton for almost 10 years ( 5-6 hours a day) and now I'm prepping for jee.
Your post really hit home .
It's REALLY hard to quit your sport even when uk u will probably not be able to make it .
I hope ur doing ok 🙃

Same , i was a fricking good gymnast but now after all these years of studying n shit i am so fat and inflexible that i surprise myself.
Lost my drawing skills, my interest in philosophy, a good relationship, and even the girl committed suicide recently...
🙂 jee took away so much of my time, effort, mental peace...
mains se ache college me chal toh jaunga, but not anymore excited about these colleges i guess...
and also, i am not feeling motivated about jee advanced...
let's see what happens..
this rat race sucks fr
You weren't a miraculous prodigy in the sport?
Then I'd say you didn't have much of a future in badminton either.
Every single field in India is competitive, and if you aren't insanely talented then you're fucked
Well, YOU chose the "stupid rat race".
Ab rr karke kya fayda

Physics was moderate, chemistry was moderate to tough-ish, maths fucked me 💀
maut is the only option left.
phy and math was moderate chem easy thi bas mujhe nahi ati thi
Pta hai mujhe screen pe paper dete hue chudh gye guru dikh rha tha🤡
acha hua nahi diya bc ek dost ne bola  
bs tha paper not sure about any else
Bhai meri to physics ne leli
Chemistry and maths decent ban gayi
mujhe chem aur phys theek lage (like adv) but bhia maths ne kaand kardiya 

but i will say that no subject was easy, cz usually in adv if a subject is tough ek subj easy hota hai but yahaan koi easy nhi thaa
4 answer tha socl2 aur elimination ka?
Bs paper   
they spammed questions typically found in module and pyqs
I think ye 2022 advanced level tha
I submitted the paper but still aisa dikha rha hai 🥲

Lmao haslo jitna hasna hai.
Next time se NEETtards Mains level kisi Phy and chem padhke aur chod denge JEE walon ko XD.
Fir JEE wale wahin third class excuse denge "Yaar It's impossible to score even 5 number in math even though I have studies it for 2 years at JEE level😿.
It's not my fault!!.
And I cannot just spend the entire 3 hours on Physics and chem(Easy subjects acc to JEE wale) because mere andar 100 logo ka ghamand baitha hai😿"
AUR 2-3 GANNE SYNC KRDO NA![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30168)
OG Edit 

And ofc, OG post 

NWKMKB
Bhai let the neet people suffer in peace, tum log to bolte ho ki bhai neet ke sare 24 lakhs give jee and beat all the people preparing for jee
Literally in my jee shift most of them were neet ppl, writing jee for practice, they would just attempt phy and chem.
Bcoz of them our cutoffs go higher.
Aake jee ppr dete the na, toh neet ki physics bhi aasani se ho jani chahiye thi inse
Bc aaj hi dekhi thi mene ye movie

Great advice for 26 tards like me The sad part is teachers don't teach that way after a point ( maybe some rare teacher does ) Heat and waves tak ate ate tho sirf class me formula hee likha jaa raha tha kuch samaj nahi aa raha tha
excellent in this exam ill say - he's right.
i abide by the same thing, had the exact same thought process as he does and its completely worked in my favor just like him.
i found someone similar gosh.
yeah but sadly most people dont study for knowledge they just want marks and wont put in any extra effort in actually understanding stuff in detail
yaha upasthit kisi bhi cutie ko jee freiend chaiye to feel free to contact me![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
fake farji neetards still gonna abuse him
No thank you, I haven't got the time to study like this.
I don't care about PCB, I care about getting into a GMC and MBBS.
I will only study as much as required.
finally someone said it

matlab nahi hai khareed ke, agar free mei mile toh hi use karna, itni koi khaas book nahi hai.
overhype kar diya hai bas
Don’t know why this method remains less known
Rarely i have seen any one teaching this .

a post actually relevant to jee?
no, impossible

jokes aside neat sol., i like that method
Seems a bit skeptical , doubt mujhe uss integral to Sigma switch mei hai .
I think there are rules where we can switch and when we cannot ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30176)
I saw these Summation+Integral approaches in those Binomial coefficient series questions.
Don't use much in normal series based.
I didn't even know this approach before, I asked GPT for a doubt and it suggested this approach.
Abe ye kya hai.
This requires you to integrate, as opposed to writing this as a telescopic series which is both faster and easier
2nd Wale ka answer 1 he kya, Maine to normal agp se kiya but us method se nahi ho raha (aapke wala)
Bonus question ka answer 2 hai kya bhai?
from where did you learn it?
Sigma 0 to infinity but how integration from 0 to 1?
Bhai ye kaise laate ho
Class mein toh explicitly aisi variations nhi batayi.
Calculus is the essence of mathematics.
It's a shame that we're taught about calc only in high school.
Check this blog out too: [https://blog.demofox.org/2022/08/09/calculating-discrete-sums-with-umbral-calculus/](https://blog.demofox.org/2022/08/09/calculating-discrete-sums-with-umbral-calculus/)
Sachin Sir karwaye the ye wala
Thanks man loved it
is the answer 2?
i tried using agp
Just a bit correction in the last slide I wrote the question wrong it was supposed to be

https://preview.redd.it/xp15ixgyy30f1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=470d206c8b11c52e4e6c18d3b695f7c591f071e3

.
Give this a try and rest the answer to first is ln(2)/4 not ln(4)/4 and answer for second question is 2 it was fairly solvable by agp .
The real deal was this question
https://preview.redd.it/py3zr3i9040f1.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=721910834f722394c01869cda0dca1ee38af90b9

This was the real bonus question .
Hope this method is useful for the the folks ..
bhai ye + tune jo books solve ki hai wo dekhke mujhe FOMO ho gaya, maine pathfinder to kya, galaxy bhi mushkil se thodi si ki hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)bas maths me \~70% black book ki hai aur PYQs ghise hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)
For which class is this?
the thing is, sigma itself is actually integration.
S=2 

AGP solve Krna tha
Hamare wale teacher ne toh esehi padhaya tha lol
6 is the answer for bonus one if consider r^2/2^r as yoi said i used derivative method
Shitpost kr ye nahi
damn this is impressive
Bhai jab chotte se tarike me ho raha ha tho tu faltu me series ko integral me kyu connvet karega aur lamb keeche ga
this is because most people are scared of integration, so mostly toppers know this trick but generally most teachers dont teach this.
Thank you IIT kanpur
For being so inconsiderable for us who are from border areas!!we lost our 4-5 days and still not have fully recovered and you still cannot postpone our exam for a week or two…

Bhai i understand your struggles , but agar vo log paper shift karenge to counselling ka time slot hil jayega.
Plus next week of adv mai BITSAT hoga to adv ko June mai karana padhega jo ki bohot late hoga .
Secondly adv ka paper hai jm ka nhi ki last din padh kuch ukhad lenge , 1 week hai revise karlo simple 

Still be safe .
Bro jee tests your dedication over two years, a week won’t matter.
I can understand that you have been traumatised seeing the firing, but it’s gonna take time to fade away.
They can’t postpone the exam for long as it would delay the start of semester 1.
Best of luck for your exam!
koi circular pass kiya kya unhone k exam postpone nhi hogi?(genuienly puch rha hu)
Bhai I agree with you all even if u have prepared really well for 2 years the constant stress and anxiety of war, sirens and gunshots can traumatize you and physiology plays a very very important role in jee advance although I wish you the best bhai positive mindset rakho 🙏
Result kab arha hai cbse ka🤡faltu itne dine se dimaag kharab
Result hai ya upsc ki vacancy bhari Jaa rhi .
Itne din se bas suspense hai pta nhi kab ayega results.

Coding and all idk either so cant help with that but experience ke saath everything works out 😎
Ok so i will be appearing for my neet exam in 2026 and i am studying in aakash rn.
I have been doing pretty good in aakash tests and all and like i normally score about 690-710 in the tests.
Where my marks used to reduce were biology questions that were strictly out of ncert.
But i never cared about them coz people told me that neet is strictly ncert based atleast for bio and aakash waalon ko aadat hai zyada karane ki.
But seeing 2025 ka paper i am a little scared coz 3-4 question were strictly out of NCERT there aswell but voh aakash ki modules mein bhi nahi the.
Can anyone suggest me ki kahan se like extra kar sakta hu ya modules hi karna shuru karu.
(NCERT meine ratti hui hai to usko abh baar baara karne ka koi fayda nahi)

yaha 18×499 kyu subtract kiya hai.
like 500 moles of both liya  hai na toh wudnt it be -18x999 
cus agar lets say 2 moles of both liye hote

2 mole milke ek mole pani nikalta hai
yeah ur right op, it's 999\*18 to be subtracted.
Also they have given wrong answer too (obv because wrong method)
1 ester linkage se 1 water molecule create hoga, total number of linkages dekhlo.
1 polymer unit jbb attach hoga toh ussei 1 h20 niklega,

Yahan total 500 co-polymer units bnn rhei,  
Mtlb indiviudally 1000 monomer units hain

1 water molecule banega copolymer unit bannei pe, dusra copolymer ke apas mei combine hone se, toh 2 moecules niklenge,

ends pe acid aur hydroxy free form mei hoga oth 1000-1 = 999 h20 molecules liberated.
Simple aise krr skte  
Total number of ester linkages = Total no.
of monomers - 1

Rant about my parents.
So after doing not so well in JEE 2025, I decided to take a drop.
Now my friend's mother and my mother are very close friends.
Today in the afternoon, my friend's mother calls my mother saying that my friend has got chance in VIT Chennai and he has taken admission.
I decided not to give VITEEE this year coz why waste money on exam fees when I know I will take drop either way and will try another shot at IITs and NITs.
Now my mother is saying that I did a grave mistake of taking a drop, your friend is already 1 year ahead of you now !
She is also saying that "you should have given VITEEE too , why didn't you give it ?!, you will not be able to crack JEE in drop year".
She adds that "you have been sitting in the house for so long without any success , this looks so bad"

I kinda feel sad and demotivated now.
Edit: Its VIT Chennai not Vellore

Chhoti chhoti baato pe tension le lete ho
Bhai koi na mummy ko bharosa dilwao that you can deserve better than vit, study hard and crack a good government college.
abhi kuch mat bol aur padhne pe dhyan de ....
Agle saal jab better college milega tab unko khud smjh aa jaega 



Aur nahi mila to tujhe smjh aa jaega
jb kuch bda krne ka socho toh koi na koi rokega hi tension mt lo aur aage badh jao aur dekho yaad rakhna kaun support kiya tumko tumhare low point pe 

  
from a dropper
Unki baat bhi sahi hai cuz she is tensed ki agar galti se kum aaye ya kuch toh pura saal waste hoga
Just asking but is saal mains me kitne aaye ?
I got 14XX rank, ispe bhi cat 1 me CS ki koi specialization bhi nhi milegi kya Vellore me?
Meri first 4 choices were CS and it's specializations at Vellore and fifth one was VIT Chennai CS core, and I fucking got that.
Hell naw it was all a waste man, but I'm gonna try my best for ADV, and BITSAT, also IAT bhi hai.
Honestly from experience vit chennai isn't the best college.
Bro itne restrictions hote hein and some teachers are extremely dedicated that max students get back.
N quality isn't that grt too trust me.
your mom was fine with drop because she thought it was a better decision for you to try harder again.
Then your friends mom told her that and by comparing she felt you were behind your peers(total redflag in parents book).
No worries..word hard and secure a govt college 😀
Chill bro;
Same was the situation with my friend.
He took drop, his relatives started scaring his parents that drop year is risky, he won't make it, "drop year me pressure bahot hoti hain" and what not.
But my friend assured his parents and scored 99.1 percentile in the drop attempt.
So it's on you, your hardwork, your efforts that will shut the mouth of such people!
All the best bro❤️
Chill re kr lega tu
Use it as fuel op..
Khud ko prove karne ke liye..
I know a friend, his mother said you can never score good marks in front of their relatives in a serious meeting about his academics ( his relatives are doctor, iitians, teachers, ias and all ) He says people behave in certain manner in front of certain people or in the influence of certain people, just look at them as immatures and remember don't get blind while doing that, it can be dangerous and also keep touching yourself no one is going to do that for you.
( all his words )
ladki hai kya bhai itni si baat mei demotivate kon hota?
Fir mat hi le drop tera jee nhi hua toh tu zindagi pr demotivated feel krega

Bhai ne ab tak saare solution videos dekh liye honge and ab solve karke bolega "Ye toh basic level hai.
Is ko tum tough man rahe ho toh tum nishant jindal ka lund chus ke nhi aaye ho.
Uska 2470 ka batch leke uski IIT delhi aluminium rod se apni chudwa lo fir pura paper leak hojayega jee advanced ka tumhare man mein🔥🥵🥵"
Final year mai h yeh thek h ?
ab tak isne bataya ki placement kha hui ?
isko lagta h yeh chutiyapa karna sahi h, bc har koi jee tutor hai aaj kal, fir isko kuch bol do justify karne lag jate hai yeh, ki NIT bhi nikalni mushkil hoti h yeh wo pata hai bhai terko tere chutiyap ki vajah se hate milti h 22-23 saal ki umar mai yeh 17-18 saal ke bacho se compete krna chahta hai obv bhai tu kar dega tune 4 saal engineering kari h calculations tez hongi but sense wali baat toh kar, koi inko expose bhi nahi krta yeh or wo nishant bkl, tabhi hame weapons import krne padte h kyuki hamare engineers jee vs neet kar rahe hai, jo chez already ho chuki h wo yeh dubara kar raha hai, unacademy brought all kota teachers online yeh woi concept copy kar  raha hai, fir iit dickride krta hai abey itna hi iit ka tag flex krne ka shok hai toh kuch create kar na kya yeh bc dusre ki app pe teachers lake lectures upload krke khud ko assume kar raha hai ki bhut bada founder h dono chutiye hai bkl
This clown just wants to show that JEEtards are superior to NEETards and can solve NEET physics easily
NEET ka paper is chutiye ko nipta dega 1 ghante me
Pata nahi tha ye banda iss level tak gir jayega apne jee ke students ko cater karne ke liye
Isko log dekhte bhi kyun hai , drop leke bhi civil hi milli isko

i was relaxed in bed tho.
Dikhana chahta hai bache kitne chutiye hai
Ye influencer madarchod college se pass hoke bhi college pe hi fixated hote hai aur tum chutiye Inka content consume karte ho 
Tumhari insecurities ke sath khelna hi to Inka Kam hai 
21 sal ka banda 18 sal ke bacho ki level ki physics kyu nahi kar payega lol
Bhai yeh khudko bhaiya kyu bulate hai, bc shobhit ko shobhit bhaiya bulwane ke liye soviet ne hi shuru kara tha
'your careerwill be destroyed"
Is it so hard to just accept that it was tough this year for neetards?
Can't we just make peace among ourselves?
What are such people trying to achieve by doing this?
We should support each other, not look down on each other for our weaknesses
grown ahh man btw
Yeh apni college ka padhai chorke, neet ka questions kyun solve kar raha hai?
Bhai let's be honest neet ka paper itna bhi hard nhi tha ki tum use jee advanced ke level ka bologe it was just diff than usual isliye tumhe hard laga .
And funfact iss baar sabka format change hua jee cet neet so pls don't .
What this guy is doing is for views kyuki woh chutiya hai lekin tumhara paper itna hard bhi nhi tha c'mon .
Lmao NEET Physics 1 ghante m koi bhi solve karde, paper m ques hard nahi the ques lengthy the.
30-40 mins m solve karni thi puri Physics, pressure ke andar aur jab paper pattern random hogya ho.
F this niqqa and F 247, jaha dikhe vaha maaro.
Chutiye ne drop year me 97 percentile layi aur ab bkl 10 din me advanced ka gyan deta hai
what do you want to proof by posting screenshot of a post which is 3 days old, just for farming some views?

i even read air as A.I.R
Air isn't wind bro..
wind is flowing air..
basics bhi bhul gye kya?😔 (hella disappointed)
jab mei chota tha aur paper mei air 56,78  etc dekhta tha toh YHI sochta tha ki yeh hai kya
used to see air 1 , 234 in newspaper ads as a kid and thought it must be pilot exam because AIR !
Well before that it was All India Radio.
Like saying you are live on AIR.
Air never really meant wind actually ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49199)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30176)
Mujhe toh lgta tha pilots ki ranking hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49464)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49199)
How tf air can be wind😡
until AIR was all india radio
It took me 5 attempts to understand ts 🥀
air aint wind bro,air is a mixture of gases
Who's gonna tell him wind and air are not same thing.
Jiski jitni achhi AIR woh utha Hawa mein udta hein
Mera toh yeh Mann na tha
Also when Alakh was "sir"not "daddy" ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
NO air is a fluid
Bhai jab mai chota tha mujhe samjh mai hi nahi ata tha itne bade poster air 1,2,3 likh ke kyu laga rha bhai sachme mai confuse hi ho jata tha ki air mai bhi ranking hoti hai kya ?
Actually life was fun till 10th

Went to IIT KGP for ISI Exam , never felt more Depressed
Visited after 2 years (12+drop) , Not the first time going there as it's my hometown , 

Man the lavish green and huge campus, the big hall like classrooms , road , foot path and a different path for cycles and the huge buildings and the calm atmosphere , 

All of these could've been the part of my next 4 years, but honestly I don't think I deserve anything, the one who actually sacrificed everything is the deserving one , someone like me who just studied for the sake of it , shouldn't really be here .
As I write this , there's nothing but a heavy weight on my heart, Maybe not now but definately I'll reach a place like this in the future.
For now , I'll just study for advanced and then bitsat , No more Regrets.

Is LPU BAD your opinions
Concern about LPU's AICTE Approval
I recently spoke with an admission counselor who advised against joining Lovely Professional University (LPU) due to its lack of AICTE approval for certain programs.
According to them, this could lead to difficulties in placements, limited applicability of my degree outside India, and ineligibility for government engineering job exams.
However, upon further research, I discovered that LPU is UGC-approved, which seems to contradict the counselor's claims.
I'm now uncertain about the implications of pursuing a degree from LPU without AICTE approval.
Key Questions
- Does UGC approval suffice for engineering programs, or is AICTE approval necessary?
- Will the lack of AICTE approval affect my career prospects and degree recognition?
- Are there any specific government job exams or industries that require AICTE-approved degrees?
Seeking Clarification
I'd appreciate it if seniors or experts could provide insights into this matter.
I'm worried that if I join LPU, I might face challenges in the future, potentially wasting my four-year engineering degree.

We Lost 3 of Our Friends to a Drowning Tragedy Please Be Careful
I’m a first-year MBBS student at a Government Medical College in Maharashtra.
Recently, our college faced a devastating loss—three of our dear classmates and friends drowned in a tragic incident.
As the first batch of our college, this grief has hit us especially hard.
We’re young,  and none of us were prepared for something like this.
Our internal examinations ended 2-3 days ago and everyone was so stress free and eager to have fun.
Some of us decided to go out for swimming in a nearby river but all of them did not returned.
Even after trying best, we lost them.
The entire hostel is mourning.
Watching their parents in pain was one of the most heartbreaking moments of our lives.
If anyone has been through something similar, your guidance and words would mean a lot.
Please—take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
One moment of carelessness can lead to irreversible loss.
Let’s not wait for tragedy to remind us how fragile life really is.

I'm really sorry to hear this but I have to ask.
Why will someone try to swim if he don't know swimming?
Is this any kind of adrenaline rush ?
(I mean no disrespect)
That's why I always try to resist adventurous activities , because there are always some trouble maker that may hamper our lives.

lets fucking go ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30180)
who remembers rajwant sir ka tiruchirappalli
need advice on switching batches
thinking of switching to the toppers batch but i’m really torn

so i’m in one of the regular batches right now — it’s pretty chill, and honestly that’s been good for me because i’ve got backlogs and they go a bit slower here, so i can actually understand what’s going on in class.
but i’ve been thinking about switching to the toppers batch.
i’m scoring the same as the people there anyway, so that’s not really the issue.
a couple of my friends switched and said they’re studying so much more just because they’re scared of being the dumbest ones there — which sounds intense, but also like really good motivation.
they move faster, spend more time on questions, and the overall pressure just makes you work harder.
in theory it sounds perfect.
but at the same time, i do have backlogs and i don’t understand some concepts, so i’m scared the fast pace will just leave me behind.
plus, i was in that batch for a bit last year and i had horrible anxiety.
it was awkward and i couldn’t focus at all.
in my current class i actually have friends and it’s really nice, which i kinda need right now since i had literally no one in 11th which gave me anxiety and anxiety = i cannot study.
but then again, it’s jee.
nothing else really matters.
i probably won’t even see these people again after this year, and i know i’m not reaching my full potential where i am now.
i could definitely be working harder and i genuinely think i could make it to an NIT if i push myself more.
i was thinking of asking for a trial week to see how i do there before deciding, but i’m so conflicted.
has anyone else switched batches like this?
did it help or just make things worse?

Yeah, this occured to me during 11th end.
I had switched to topper's batch one month before 12th and it seemed very different for me.
So, I switched back to my regular batch.
But after 11th final exams (of coaching) I switched back again to topper's batch.
Now, this was definitely difficult at first but I coped with it and got adjusted to the pace by working more harder.
Now this definitely is worth it because you not only get motivation but also new experiences of different thoughts and study styles.
The decorum of the class is just at a whole different level there.
I say you do go for a trial week and try your best to adjust in that batch.
All up to you.
Mene kiya tha switch bkl pura flow hi tut gaya jis batch me ho usi me raho agar tumhara under 1500 rank ka caliber ha to hi effect hoga varna kuch zayada farak nahi padta topper batch se.
Aur agar tumhara ek subject bahaut weak ha to kar bhi mat lena gand mar jayegi.
Baki ye batches se zyada farak nahi padta, better you give time to more questions and mock tests, kam padhlo par jitna padho vo yad rahana chaiye and doubts clear rakho sare,bahaut aachi rank aayegi.

Whats your branch and what made you choose it, also does someone get enough time for hobbies and personal projects other than academic

The point of postponement was made due to the possibility of going to w*r, not because some people lost 5 damn days of prep 🤡 like, I know this sounds bad and I'm gonna get downvoted to oblivion, but I'll still say it : these 5 days wouldn't have changed your rank.
It depends on 2 years for god's sake ;-;

The mental pressure of w*r could have worsened your rank but you shouldn't worry about those things anymore now.
And if it does happen, advanced will surely get postponed.
So please stop whining about shitty reasons and get some actual reasons to cry about; there are actual reasons present here too 🫡

Those who started preparing for JEE adv in apr , they think they can crack it .
But the reality is yk
You're right at least for the people far from border areas can't comment on people in Jammu & other border areas as we can't see how much they have been through
Bro Mood is also a thing my cousin used to get 220+ in mocks at allen but during exam he drained out and was frustrated he scores 177 in 2024 paper and 2024 was easiest
its not because 5 days of prep were lost, its because people in some areas are facing constant blackouts and drone attacks which are a risk to their lives, trains and other sources of travel are getting cancelled how are those people supposed to commute to another city to write their exams in such conditions?
also their might be some people who got injured or lost someone close to them in the conflict how are they supposed to show up for an exam for quick?
its a life deciding exam these factors should have been taken into consideration

nahi aya kisi ko 6-7 baar bhej diya aur kisi ko bheja hi nahi
Completed 1st yr at DTU CSE…AMA
Got 99.6X percentile in JEE MAINS 2024 
Ask me ur doubts

Edit: If some more questions..u can dm me


>I tried to answer most of the question…It was really nice experience interacting with u all.
So lets end this AMA .
Should i go for IPU top cse or DTU EE
is girls to boys ratio that bad?
how are the placement figures if you could tell?
how's life in delhi?
bro i am getting cs in dtu  

have few questions:

How is college life there?
Does it have diversity(based on regions)?
Is cse good there campare to nit kkr or PEC?
How are hostels single room or shared?
Are you happy mate?
what would you advice for a person like me who doesn't have particular interest in any subject/field just want a good college for exposure (tho ain't getting anything at my rank) (not asking for college options, just asking for general advice what to do next, I still have shot left)
Bhai EE ka kaisa haal hai udhar?
is dtu mnc a better option than nsut cs?
what about electrical in dtu vs nsut cs, ive heard branch upgrades after 1st year are very common in dtu?
Should I prefer NITW ECE Homestate or DTU CSE (Non delhi) I am ok with both cse and ece (Used to do coding and arduino before jee prep)
Kitna kharcha aayega 4 saal ka?mess or hostel nhi chaiye
First of all congratulations 
Please answer the following 
1) Hostels kaise hai ?
Like 1st year me kaise hostel allot hote hai (1 seater,2seater Ac/non ac wagera wagera)
2) Crowd and peers kaise hai , stereotypes hota hai ki Delhi me bohut ladai jhagda hai is this true?
Also pollution wagera toh nahi hai na itna 😭🙏
3) Hostels me restrictions hai kya?
Like agar raat ko mera man karein campus ghumne ka toh mai ghum sakta hu?
4) sports facilities and events kaise hai ?
5) Seniors ragging lete hai kya?
6) Your most memorable memory in college?
I'm on a borderline of getting ECE and can get EE , so how's life in both DTU EE vs ECE, pls tell about the free time we may get for coding or other skill development and what should I consider while choosing between the two...
Like ik it's not your department but still you can give some insight...
Please tell the difference between IT vs CSE vs SE...
I can get NSUT CSAI and DTU IT what should I choose?
(Outside Delhi basically I live in NCR)
So i think i tried answer all the questions so we can end this AMA in 5 mins
why you chose dtu?...i mean at that percentile you could've get ece/cse in good nits
nsut cs  VS dtu cs  VS nit w/s eee VS nit t ice VS nit rourkela / jaipur / allahbad ece VS  / IIIT banglore / allahbad ECE , rank 10.6k with around 1300 rank ews male home state punjab , rest mostly me cse h like jamshedpur etc
got 98.6 %ile in mains, might get SE in DTU from delhi quota, i've been preparing for adv for the past 2 years, my prep is good, but im probably not gonna get an under 2k rank, i want CS,AI or MnC only.
should i go for bitsat after advanced or is dtu se better?
I am getting DTU Mechanical as a Non delhi student.
How's the placement scenario currently in Non circuital branches.
Also Ragging hoti hai kya abhi bhi  ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
How is mechanical with specialisation in automobile at dtu?
How's is dtu cse compared to like nit kkr cse or iiith cse or bits cse 
Packages placements college life and all
Any core diff btw cse IT and se.
I am getting IT in dtu nsut or should I go for igdtuw for top branches like cse csai
IIIT H ECE vs DTU CS vs NIT W CS vs IIIT B CS
How is electronic engineering at DTU?
Considering ECE how is it ?
Placement ka thoda idea dedo (Median🥺)
Please answer a few questions of mine 

1.
Can you tell me about mechanical engineering in auto motion engineering of dtu ?
Like how's the branch ?
I am getting mech in dtu, electronics in nsut and cs ai in iet lucknow what should I prefer if I want to pursue masters too in ai or ml (might be sapne suhane ladkpan k but yeah that's my plan)
Is it worth it?
And can a person get a good rank in advance if he/she starts now?
What's ur opinion about it?
What path should that person follow?
( Asking for a friend who only i can see and talk)
do you really have interest in cse?
are you from delhi mate?
GENDER RATIO ALSO WHICH ARE U INTERESTED IN BOYS OR GOALS?
NIT KURUKSHETRA EE vs DTU ECE papa bol rhe he ki NIT ka naam he DTU ka nhi he
bhai i am getting iiit delhi cse/csai and DTU IT/SE (or cse in spot round)..and i have no hopes from advance..i can only get lower branches in top 7 iits(like geotech,ocean eng.) i want to do a startup in future..so how is the crowd there in dtu..??
and also are hostel facilities available for delhites..because dtu is only 25km from my home..i am open to take a drop for iit..so is it worth it?
i have supported parents..so no issue with that..and how is the startup culture there??
and course load in cs related branches..??
And i may go abroad for foreign..so how would you rate DTU tag compared to TOP 7 IITs..
DTU ChE ka koi idea hai apko?
I am getting CS in all DTU/NSUT/IIIT DELHI 
(Am up dommicile sab college hi aas paas hai mere yha se)


i heard iiit D have better placements but worst college life is it true?
So Which college according to you should I prefer considering i also want some college life 

Can't get trapped in a room and do coding for 4 years need some social life too(fests,clubs etc).
ALSO - How is SE have better ctc and highest package than cs in DTU?
Mait /usict  kaisa h lena chaiye ky
So i scored 99.8x percentile in JEE Mains (2k rank)  
I live in delhi, and DTU is like 10 min bus away from my home  
That's it for the context, here are my questions:   
1.
I have heard professors are really bad in DTU, especially CSE branch, is it true?
I have been a doubt-asker from the start, and wants to, basically understand every subject in the class itself, will i be able to do it without getting on prof's bad side?
(I also want to maintain good relationship with professors, never know when it might help)  
2.
If i get BITS Pilani cse, should i go for it?
Is it so much better than DTU cse in your opinion, considering it's fees and that i'll have to get out of home  
3.
In DTU, there are a lot of students, how do you identify good and high value ones from the bad ones?
Joining societies, libraries, etc.?
(Basically how to make good friends that push each other to be the best, espcially since if i join, i'll be a day scholar)  
4.
How exactly is startup culture promoted in DTU, if you have any insights regarding it, please do share  
5.
How is internships for your batch currently?
Does any of the people you know has a great internship offer?
(Even tho they might have to take sem leave of smth?) (Please share the earning if possible too)  
6.
I, basically, yearn to be the best, have the best cgpa i can get as possible, while being the best in coding too, and at some point in my life, i surely wanna try opening a startup, but if not, atleast a top 10 package after 4 years offered to the college, if i were to do a job (I'm willing to work extremely hard, and i'm quite interested in coding and startups and i know i'm gonna be able to handle the coursework nicely too)..
That, along with having a great peer group that has the same mindset as me.
So yeah, my point is, what would you advice to someone like me?
Also the college too, DTU?
If i get a good rank in BITSAT, BITS Pilani?
(I am trying my best for IIT-Roorkee ECE too, but i'm just looking at the worst case scenario options for now)

Thanks.
Bhai should I go for IIITD Electronics+VLSI, NSUT ECE or DTU EE?
Also waiting for Advanced but which one of these 3 is better placement and opportunity wise??🙏🏻
Okay so NOT related to CSE but is Software Engineering a good branch.
I have delhi quota but my house is like 40km away from DTU.
will i be able to get a hostel?
bhaiya I will be getting ee at dtu so 

.jaise log kehte hai ki ee is tough hardwork krna padega

toh it means daily padna padega 5-6 ghante
im sexually attracted to physics.
why did you not take CSE in any nits??
DTU me MnC mil rhi hai bhai, agar adv me under 2k nhi aayi to sahi hoga lena(rohini se hi hu XDXD)
leaving cse aside baki jitni bhi branches hai wah due to homestate quota , people get admission at very low ranks, dont you think it affects the overall quality of crowd and overall clg life, placements since top branches mein bhi delhi quota se kafi low rank pe cse mil jati hai compared to tier 1 nits jah sab 10k ke neeche hi milta hai?
Prefer last branches in DTU vs CS IT in MAIT MSIT??
DU college me rhe kr DTU CSE ke liye target kru?
Abhi mains bekar gya h, aur college lena pdega taaki saal n barbad ho.
Kya Krna hoga mujhe?
Waha par societies ka kya scene hai?
Teachers kaise hai waha ke?
Kya mai apni hacking ki journey start kr paunga?
how is sports facilities in DTU?
16k obc rank
51k crl
Other state male k kya mil sakta ha bhai??
how is mechanical in dtu (core mechanical, wont be going into coding), mba krna hai baad mein so just looking forward to good exposure and college life
So hedge funds /qaunt firms come to MnC for recruitment?
Nsut i feel would be better
subah jaldi kese uthe
What's better dtu ee or nsut ece
I've heard some negative reviews regarding the crowd there?
how true is this?I'll be getting cs at dtu so do you think it's worth choosing?i have other  options like iiitb ece too
Damn we had the same percentile, I also chose DTU before adv
I want to go for space science, but also have a safe placement backup.
My advance preparation is not as good to get me rank under 4k, might get around 8k.
So i am thinking if adv does not go well, i have to leave my dream and just go for ee in dtu, i got 19.6k rank hs.
Is it a good decision?
(1) How was your jee advanced result?
(2) How is crowd at DTU as i am considering this as backup plan?

Compiled Cutoff Sheet for BTech Admissions (JoSAA, UPTAC, IPU) | 2024–2025
Hey guys, I made a full table with colleges, admission mode, home state info, cutoffs, and basic fee details too.
Covered NSUT, DTU, HBTU, MMMUT, IPU colleges, AKTU side ones, and some privates.
Cutoffs are approximate and based on 2024 trends — can vary a little.

good work bhai but ipu ke colleges ke fees badh chuki hai pls check from college pravesh and update also you have mentioned ggsipu/usict two times in this sheet
Ok guys, so here’s the final decision.
I had made a post yesterday regarding some tasks.
The top comment said a 100hr effective work week.
But it didn’t specify a task.
So the next one said to leave Reddit till 2026, i cant do that since I have mentioned a reason.
There were some good ones, and I chose them.
And ofc I’ll not solve PnC.
And also, I don’t have time for that🥲.
Thank you guys, I’ll message those people and update them.
If all goes well, I’ll probably come back again very soon.
Was also surprised to see the 99.7 didi.

Hello to the people of this sub,

As a fellow aspirant, I’m reaching out for some guidance—particularly from seniors and experienced members of the community.
I’ll try to keep this honest and to the point.
I began my JEE preparation right after Class 10 and enrolled in the two-year program at FIITJEE.
My 11th grade went quite well—I consistently ranked within the top 20 in the center-level Phase Tests and performed decently in the weekly FCATs.
I had developed a solid grasp of Advanced-level Physics and was reasonably confident in Maths, although Chemistry was never really my strong suit.
Unfortunately, things took a downturn in 12th grade.
My core faculty left, and the rest were reshuffled.
Batch sizes doubled from 30 to 60 due to internal mismanagement—mainly because FIITJEE reportedly failed to pay staff salaries on time.
I was assigned to relatively inexperienced teachers and struggled to follow along.
Gradually, I began relying more on PW and online lectures.
Looking back, I think this is where I went wrong.
After July or August 2024, I focused almost entirely on watching lectures and did very little problem-solving.
Unlike in 11th, where I completed most of the Panini series modules, I barely touched them in 12th.
As of now, I’ve fallen short of my expectations in JEE Mains and didn’t qualify for JEE Advanced.
I’m considering taking a drop year to prove myself and rebuild the trust of my parents.
I really need some solid guidance moving forward.
My Drop-Year Study Plan

• Mathematics

1.NCERT overview

2.FIITJEE module

3.Cengage

4.The Black Book (for advanced-level problem solving)


• Physics

1.NCERT overview

2.FIITJEE module

3.Physics Galaxy

4.I.E.
Irodov (have already done some questions in 11th)


• Chemistry

1.Physical: NCERT → FIITJEE module → N.
Awasthi

2.Organic: NCERT → My own notes (based on MS Chauhan’s JEE edition of Solomon/Fryhle) → Advanced Illustrations by MS Chauhan

3.Inorganic: NCERT → JD Lee → FIITJEE module → VK Jaiswal


In addition, I plan to solve FIITJEE’s GMP and Review Booklet series for all three subjects, along with a PYQ Archive book.
Is this study plan and choice of reference books sufficient to score well in JEE Advanced?
Should I add or remove any books from this list?
Would it be better to follow a completely different strategy instead of relying so much on reference books?
Is using too many books a mistake?
Will it cause more confusion or burnout?
I want to focus heavily on question-solving, especially in Chemistry.
I've already gone through a lot of theory—can you suggest any good practice books or resources specifically for that?
Are there other books you’d recommend that might be better suited for my level or situation?
Lastly, any general advice for someone planning to take a drop year—be it regarding mindset, scheduling, mock test frequency, or study balance—would be truly appreciated.
I’m currently feeling quite lost and overwhelmed, and I would genuinely value any suggestions, feedback, or personal experiences you can share.
Thank you in advance.

Bhai don't take so much book in consideration at all once Pehele decide Karo which book to solve wisely first setting a proper deadline and then go on further books 


Mock test frequently do par do kyuki there are no chances of leaving it which costed me degradation in marks 


Suggestion from my side ki Jitna ho sake mobile ka use bohot Kam karlena because once you get distract it is very hard to get back to track 


All the best
Tbh don't take so many books at first complete one then go to another and these books are enough good (u can remove irodov and jd lee cuz they are high level books and u won't need them unless u are planning to get a rank under 5k in mains) u can add himanshu pandey in organic section too this book is good for building bridge between mains nd adv rest all books are good, believe in urself
Does anyone have pdf of the latest edition of physics galaxy book?

how much time you get apart from your classes and assignments(like 1 hr,2hr..??)..as i have heard that the academics of IIIT H/D/B/A are pretty much same..
hows college life in general, academics ki intensity and hows the balance between extracurricular activities etc
How's the extra curricular stuff like, Fests, clubs, etc.
Also I've heard ki iiits has a very time consuming academic life, Do you get free time apart from college to do freelancing and other side hustles.
Hows the hostel facility like.
cutoff kya hai cs ki?
What is the placement ratio?
What are the total fees?
Also, can I get a loan for this college?
And what about sports like cricket are there any tournaments held?
1)Bhaiya night curfew hai kya waha?
2)ECE ke acads approx kitte tough hai?
4)triple sharing rooms hai maine sunaa hai, so thodi ghutan nhi hoti
5)hostel room ki photo ho toh please dikhaado
i know that you might not be able to answer this, but as iiit b will now consider Advanced and Olympiads for admissions aswell, do you think it might make a difference in cutoffs?
will they be increasing seats or anything?
And what is the offline campus round like, because looking at last years cutoffs i wont get anything during the other rounds (10k rank), is there a possibility that I could get something in the campus round?
Do you think ECE is worth it ?
bcs ive heard that for most places its usually the "hardest" course, for eg.
assuming I get CS (with spec) in IIIT-D, and ECE at IIIT-B, what might be the better choice for me?
He i got around 10k crl, I want to know how was your interview process during campus round of selection?
And do we need to prepare something before campus round pls tell.
Placements for companies like Nvidia and AMD for ECE core roles for how are they?
In terms of CTCs, internship oppurtunities etc
does the campus feel very small?
Is it in main bangalore?
can i get btech cs or ece here with 5.4k in mains?
what was your mains marks , and advance rank and marks?
What's the environment there like?
Do you like it there?
What about the peer group?
Do you get any time to pursue any of your hobbies?
Do they accept admission through chai paani /extra fees 💀?
Why do you think the btech jee mains closing ranks are so low
2.
Do you think it's worth it for jee mains 3000 crl ( just your opinion) 
3.
Your opinion on the packages .
Do you think they are good and since the intake has increased will the packages be affected much ?
College fees per semester including hostel ?
North indians ke sath racism kitna hai
Not related to iiit Bangalore but I am getting ee at nit Durgapur and cs in iiit naya raipur, Trichy, nagpur and many more.
Which one should I choose?
I think I am interested in coding and will look jobs in in the IT domain
How much is the fees for b tech cse ?
Is lower branch at top iit better than it in iiitA?
my main concern for collage is peer group and campus ( i dont care about placements as i would join my father's manufacturing unit business ) so is the campus good ( hostel, washroom, sports ) and is the crowd there good in terms of thinking big for future, innovation, etc or all are just job focused?
so wil IIITB be worth ?
In preparation did you ever feel very demotivated and thinking about not wanting to prepare anymore 

If yes how did you get out of the situation
do you have plag system??
Talking about relative grading, how does it work.
Let's say everyone is good so the person with least lr relativistically bad performance will get a 0??
Ye konsa phone h bhai..
bro all IIT'S NIT'S campus size is on average 300-400 acres but IIITB campus is just 9 acres toh boht chota nahi he kya IIITB?
Hey, in the requirements section it mentions Completion of 10+2 (or equivalent) with a first-class grade, with Mathematics as one of the subjects.
Do you think if one subject is a bit lower (English) would that be a problem?
What does first class mean here?
Also would you have the round wise cutoff from last year.
I swear I had seen it a few no the prior, maybe they removed it when they updated the page for this year's admissions.
Mtech k liye aaunga btech k liye aukat nhi h meri
Is your name pranav??
I got a rank of 12.4k in Jee mains and am trying for IIIT Bangalore integrated M-Tech in E.C.E.
The website does not mention when the online rounds and campus round will start.
Can you please tell when yours started.
Also kindly tell me if I can do something else to increase my chances of getting into college.
how did you make friends.
till now all my friends have been made automatically, or they approached me.
I don't know how to approach people and talk about what.
Even with people I know I have to think a lot about what to talk, and plan it in advance.
I feel that even a little bit delay might waste my time in college and by the time I actually discover good people they might already have friend groups.
I don't wan't to become lonely.
I don't even want friends but I want just one or two so that I can fit in
2.
how to fit in?
like should I start doing things like watching and playing cricket, football, i.e.
things that boys enjoy, but I don't enjoy and feel are a waste of time.
not fitting in is a thing I am afraid of.
But don't worry, I will not succumb to peer pressure for this.
how to socialise without drinking?
I am extremely against drinking and have been feeling scared since a lot of time that I will never be able to build connections and friends.
People say that you miss out potential opportunities, however what sort of opportunity does a drunkard offer, and he must be the worst kind of interaction you could get, right?
Or is it possible that when they are drinking, you drink some sort of mocktail?
you're in ECE right?
do you find course material relevant?
I have heard college is just glorified coaching with worse teachers, is it true?
did you do any project, startup or internship?
if yes, how did you get it, or find it?
Like I am asking the source, websites, process...
did you earn any money?
if yes, how
7.
did you take any clubs, PORs, etc?
do you enjoy fests?
I don't but I've heard they are important for socializing and making contacts, also I've heard PORs are good for placements, but I don't want to waste so much time on them
9.
do you have any achievements till class 12?
if no then what are your plans for writing in your CV?
If I don't have these how will I bridge this gap and not make my CV look empty?
basically i have no achievement in 12 years of my school, won no competetion, no olympiad, absolutely nothing.
except little bit programming no skill as well.
will I need to do a lot of extra projects, competitions and internships in my first year, to come at paar?
which laptop did you use?
does it work good in your specific use case (branch)?
Actually what are the use cases?
what specs are required so that you can do everything smoothly, not only for academics, but like even for extra things you do, like coding, startup etc?
because I believe I am going to use my laptop a LOT.
how to find like minded people?
by like minded, I do not mean people who share my hobbies, I want to befriend highly studious kids, like both kinds of people - toppers of college, as well as those who want to do something big and different, like a startup.
because that is important for breaking out of rat race.
When almost all people are either slogging for studies or focused on extracurricular activities then how do I balance or more importantly find people who will walk with me on my path.
how much to balance between academics and extracurriculars?
like I have interest in some clubs but not sure if I should waste 3-4 hours per day and just the thought of the freedom to do anything is pretty damn overwhelming.
will I really regret not joining clubs so much?
does height increase even after JEE?
How to stay active and fit in college and balance it with everything else you do?
Like I am thinking that I will go to swimming or gym (less preferable) daily as one last attempt to increase my height, and also stay disciplined and fit.
Do you even get time for this?
I am daydreaming that I will go swimming for half an hour every morning and that will make me fresh.
how difficult will it be to adjust with your roommate, and how to deal if he is very different from you?.
how to not waste time in college, I am not talking about academics here but instead the actually important part - personality development, money, opportunity, etc.
is it really required to do something like MTECH, PHD, CAT, GRE, GATE, UPSC?
why the heck do so many people do this?
does it help you in growing, like is BTECH not enough, is there no scope for growth in career??
IIIT H ECE VS IIIT B all branche vs NIT W CS VS DTU CS
It was my dream college
Do local students hate on people for speaking in Hindi?
Is there any type of discrimination for like North people or reservation ppl?

Joining Yakeen 2.0 for the First Time Need Help (Teachers, Test Series, Strategy, Books...Everything!)
Hey everyone
So I’m joining Yakeen 2.0 for the  first time & I’m kinda overwhelmed ngl...
I wanna go all in this year & give my absolute BEST shot at NEET so I really need your help on a bunch of things:

1.
Which teachers should I go with for each subject & WHY?
Like seriously I don’t wanna experiment & waste time switching later.
Who’s the GOAT for:

Physics (MR sir/Saleem sir)

Chemistry
Organic (Pankaj sir/ SKC sir)
Inorganic ( MD sir/ OM pandey sir)
Physical Chem (Amit sir/Sudhansu sir)

Botany (Rupesh sir/Vipin sir)
Zoology (Samapti maam/Akansha Maam)


2.
Which test series should I take Allen or Aakash or BOTH?
I heard Allen’s test series doesn’t align much with PW/Yakeen’s flow… Yakeen might end syllabus by Feb?
Should I still go for Allen test series?
Aakash’s test series ka kya scene hai good level?
Or should I just buy both?
NEETPrep Target Batch worth it or just hype?
I’ve seen so many people talk about it but idk what’s real & what’s just marketing...
Please tell me honestly if it’s worth investing in alongside Yakeen

4.
How should I plan my entire year?
Like full strategy stuff:

How to keep up with lectures AND revise properly?
How to manage questions + notes + NCERT revision + mock tests?
When should I start full syllabus tests?
Should I make notes or just revise from modules + NCERT?
Any must buy books besides modules + NCERT?
I already have Allen modules but if there’s anything killer for MCQs assertion reason or final revision  please drop names!
Time table banayein ya flow mein padhein?
Strict planning vs just showing up daily & doing whatever needs to be done what works better during NEET prep?
I know this is a lot of questions but I genuinely wanna CRUSH this year and leave no regrets...
So please if you’re a dropper / serious aspirant / done this before I’d love your advice...
Thanks a ton in advance!

Physical chemistry from faisla razaq sir he teaches in Prayas and lakshay jee
I would suggest you Rajwant sirs Prayas 2.0 physics lecture as Rajwant sir also focuses on theory and problem solving and saleem sir is less focus on bookish language and theory sir is more focused on learning Theory from problems

So please if you’re a dropper / serious aspirant / done this before I’d love your advice...
Thanks a ton in advance!

Thoughts on this ?
Can anyone tell me if this a coping video or not , is 5 years enough for NEET ?
I get it NEET isn't life but why is he demotivating others and I believe if someone really  try he can clear any exam , just like jee main 6 lakhs aspirants don't even try .
You can get 40 percentile if you leave the whole paper .

aaj toh deepseek chat gpt etc aa gaya hai jab main karta tha toh bilkul maza nahi aata isko solve karne mein   
Bhai yeh kya baat hui ki answer hi nahi hai kisi ne galat soch liya toh?????
deepseek:



The **center of mass (COM)** The **center of mass (COM)** of an average healthy person is typically located:

* **In the standing position**:
   * Slightly **anterior (front)** to the **second sacral vertebra (S2)** in the pelvis.
* Roughly **at the level of the hips**, around **55–57% of a person's height** from the feet (for an adult of average proportions).
* For men, it may be slightly higher due to broader shoulders and more upper-body muscle mass.
* For women, it tends to be slightly lower because of a wider pelvis and greater lower-body mass distribution.
* **In different postures**:
   * When **leaning forward**, the COM shifts forward.
* When **raising arms overhead**, it moves upward.
* When **bending sideways**, it shifts toward the direction of the bend.
# Why This Matters in the Original Problem

In the case of a fat person trying to touch their toes:

* Excess abdominal fat moves the COM **further forward** than in an average person.
* When bending, the COM shifts **beyond the toes**, leaving the base of support and causing a fall.
For an average healthy person, flexibility and a balanced COM allow them to touch their toes without losing balance as easily.
Starting NEET 2026 Prep.
Need Help Choosing Between YouTube Legends vs PW Yakeen 2.0 + Test Series Advice!
I’m starting my NEET 2026 preparation seriously, especially after seeing the level of NEET 2025.
I don’t want to underestimate it this time and want to start strong.
I’ve checked the subreddit wiki but couldn’t find a direct comparison on this, so I’d appreciate some guidance.
I’m currently confused between two prep routes: 

Option 1: YouTube Teachers (Old but excellent content) Physics: Ashish Arora Sir Chemistry: Organic: NS Sir Inorganic: ALK Sir Physical: Sudhanshu Sir Zoology: MD Sir Botany: Tarun Sir or Vipin Sir

Option 2: PW Yakeen 2.0 (New, structured batch) Physics: Saleem Sir Chemistry: Amin Mahajan, Sudhanshu Sir, Pankaj Sir, Om Pandey, Mohit Sir Zoology: Samapti Mam / Akansha Agarwal Mam Botany: Rupesh Sir / Vipin Sir So, YouTube lectures are old but ofc has amazing content and teachers + gives time flexibilities, And about Yakeen 2.0.
its new, teachers also looks good but I am not sure about the content and time it'll take to cover things up.
So, yeah I’d love to hear if anyone here has followed either or both.
I am down for suggestions Other Doubts: Test Series: If I follow the YouTube route, which test series (online/offline) is the best which I should pait with it to stay consistent?
Extra Materials: I use NCERT and solve PYQs from a free site.
Is there any other material I could use especially for Physics?
Maths for Physics: Is it worth polishing on basic maths for like a month or two to help with physics?
If someone can clear some of these doubts it will be very helpful!
At the end of the day, I want to improve my basic + deep understanding in every subject along with NEET.
Because I don't wanna consume content from teachers who'll say "Mere notes se bahar kuch nhi aaya", I want a better mentality like "Mere notes se bahar question aayega but you're prepared enough to solve em!" 

Thanks in advance, and all the best to everyone!

You can just call them up and say its distracting.
Id say dont think about that situation while going to exam, but be prepared to handle it.
Remember, you and them have no relation so if you have any request be fully free to make it.
they arent your professors  / teachers anyways

How is the campus overall — in terms of infrastructure, sports facilities, mess, bathrooms, and hostels?
What’s the city life like — is it good for going out with friends, roaming around, or watching movies?
Also, how’s the vibe in college?
If I want to prepare for CAT, GATE, or do freelancing, do I get enough free time along with regular college activities?
How are the placements there?
What are you researching on?
Spot round kis time conduct hota h pls share some details
College life kaisi hai?

Would you say its better than top NITs like warangal and surathkal?
hey man pls tell me if i can get something at 49k , ews hai , i am completely lost idk what to do
Hey, I am from Raipur, many of my friends/seniors have joined IIITNR, and I have also registered for IIITNR counselling this time.(My Backup Plan)

So, I have noticed, many of the people there don't have a proper LinkedIn/ GitHub account even at the 3rd/4th year(they just have diff club names of the college in their experiences),  
so is it like only few people are interested in the branch, or like what is the ratio of people really interested for their branch vs people who just want a degree.
Also, are there enough opportunities and time for internships/hackathons in the college?
could you please tell us about some of the top companies hiring this year?
What do you think about Nit Raipur IT?
I am getting cse in iiit nr and it in nit Raipur.
Regarding the accomodation I will stay outside in raipur.
What's the median / mean package for ECE in IIIT Naya Raipur?
College ka infra kaisa hai.....
Hostel sabko milta hai?
aur clubs sports ka kya scene hai IIIT raipur mea
Hello bhaiya 
Cse in IIIT NR, IIIT PUNE OR BIT MESRA
my main priority is placements
Bhai kitna cool lag rhi h photo 🙇
how did you make friends.
till now all my friends have been made automatically, or they approached me.
I don't know how to approach people and talk about what.
Even with people I know I have to think a lot about what to talk, and plan it in advance.
I feel that even a little bit delay might waste my time in college and by the time I actually discover good people they might already have friend groups.
I don't wan't to become lonely.
I don't even want friends but I want just one or two so that I can fit in
2.
how to fit in?
like should I start doing things like watching and playing cricket, football, i.e.
things that boys enjoy, but I don't enjoy and feel are a waste of time.
not fitting in is a thing I am afraid of.
But don't worry, I will not succumb to peer pressure for this.
how to socialise without drinking?
I am extremely against drinking and have been feeling scared since a lot of time that I will never be able to build connections and friends.
People say that you miss out potential opportunities, however what sort of opportunity does a drunkard offer, and he must be the worst kind of interaction you could get, right?
Or is it possible that when they are drinking, you drink some sort of mocktail?
you're in ECE right?
do you find course material relevant?
I have heard college is just glorified coaching with worse teachers, is it true?
did you do any project, startup or internship?
if yes, how did you get it, or find it?
Like I am asking the source, websites, process...
did you earn any money?
if yes, how
7.
did you take any clubs, PORs, etc?
do you enjoy fests?
I don't but I've heard they are important for socializing and making contacts, also I've heard PORs are good for placements, but I don't want to waste so much time on them
9.
do you have any achievements till class 12?
if no then what are your plans for writing in your CV?
If I don't have these how will I bridge this gap and not make my CV look empty?
basically i have no achievement in 12 years of my school, won no competetion, no olympiad, absolutely nothing.
except little bit programming no skill as well.
will I need to do a lot of extra projects, competitions and internships in my first year, to come at paar?
which laptop did you use?
does it work good in your specific use case (branch)?
Actually what are the use cases?
what specs are required so that you can do everything smoothly, not only for academics, but like even for extra things you do, like coding, startup etc?
because I believe I am going to use my laptop a LOT.
how to find like minded people?
by like minded, I do not mean people who share my hobbies, I want to befriend highly studious kids, like both kinds of people - toppers of college, as well as those who want to do something big and different, like a startup.
because that is important for breaking out of rat race.
When almost all people are either slogging for studies or focused on extracurricular activities then how do I balance or more importantly find people who will walk with me on my path.
how much to balance between academics and extracurriculars?
like I have interest in some clubs but not sure if I should waste 3-4 hours per day and just the thought of the freedom to do anything is pretty damn overwhelming.
will I really regret not joining clubs so much?
does height increase even after JEE?
How to stay active and fit in college and balance it with everything else you do?
Like I am thinking that I will go to swimming or gym (less preferable) daily as one last attempt to increase my height, and also stay disciplined and fit.
Do you even get time for this?
I am daydreaming that I will go swimming for half an hour every morning and that will make me fresh.
how difficult will it be to adjust with your roommate, and how to deal if he is very different from you?.
how to not waste time in college, I am not talking about academics here but instead the actually important part - personality development, money, opportunity, etc.
is it really required to do something like MTECH, PHD, CAT, GRE, GATE, UPSC?
why the heck do so many people do this?
does it help you in growing, like is BTECH not enough, is there no scope for growth in career??
will the intake increase like last year ece ke liye 48k kuch gaya tha (55k ha ik hard but just asking) 
also what is ntpc reservation (dont have chattisgarh state quota)
bro what are the disadvantages of joining iiit bcoz i am getting iiitdm kancheepuram cse
I got 65 k rank and 19 k cat obc ncl 19k will I be able to get ece or cse in it...and I want to know that what is ece ...what do they teach...will I be learning programming to some extent ...iiit naya raipur in csab round
Din mein kitni baari hilate ho ?
Maybe a little out of context   
What's your take on IIIT Vadodara in comparision to Naya raipur ?
Can you list my pros highlighting which is better taking into consideration that I am more inclined towards cocurricular activities and fests rather than just good placements
Is Ragging common places in colleges?
If so, how to prepare against it
i heard that mostly placements are off campus , like jo 17 avg median de rakha hai website pe vo mostly off campus data hai , i wanted to know ki how much it gonna affect someone who is targeting a min 19LPA package on campus ?
i m getting DSAI easily , and CS my rank is just 50 rank below the last year closing rank so i'll try CS too ,  
ha ik placement to 4 year ke mere efforts pe depend karegi , but i can do pretty well , as my interest is in coding since class 11 .
98% in IT subject i learnt java , and HTML already , but i m mostly looking for a clg jaha on campus hi placement ke chances ho , i dont want that risk of off campus
Bhaiya kya college me aane ke baad aap noty hogaye ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
What's the closing rank bhaiyya
I am getting nit raipur cse, iiit raipur cse, iiit kota cse
Which one to prefer???

lone pair is in resonance so it wont count in hybridization hence nitrogen is sp2 hybridized
Bhai aapne upar khud likha hai lp single double bhe condition hoti hai iss case me N me pass lp hai isliye wo karega ye jo sp2 ya sp hone chahiye ye aromatic ke condition hoti hai jaha tak mujhe pata
Lp is in reso so not counted for hydridization,for hybridization see hybrid structure

Did bro just say KE = ma 💔🥀🪫
Lost in translation 🥀🥀
Even the name of this show is Fire "Force"
Newton's second law of work acceleration theorem 🥀
kinetic energy = mass times acceleration

force= mass times acceleration

therefore, kinetic energy = force (eq-1)

also show name= fire force (eq-2)

therefore substituting eq-1 in eq-2 

we get,

show name= fire kinetic energy..
david productions mentioned 👆👆 

(its over for ya'll after sbr and jojolion)
A fellow fire force watcher?
wtf does that rose mean?
Am I just not qualified enough to understand this shit ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
it's anime, so no
Me in jee :
name itself say fire "force"
Force's unit is kg×m/s^2 (Newton) and K.E is kg×m^2 /s^2 (Joules) so K.E is Newton×Meters so they are closely related but not same
Lol I saw this ep today in the morning and this sentence was funny to read.
Peak episode tho shit will only get better ( you'll know if you've read the manga )

Bro sneaked jadavpur in tier 1 as if no one would notice
IIT Hyderabad should be elite 😭 kya matlab Mera advanced bhi qualify nahi hone waala
Bhu elite but not hyderabad??
ehh dtu nsut at the same level as iit hyd ....idk.
i feel top of 1.5 or scraping tier 1
Brother in no way are coep and vjti tier 1.5

Shocking fact but Google doesn't even visit coep or vjti anymore but they do visit VIT 

So make what you want of it

And this is confirmed by my friend who is in VIT but has 16xx rank in JEE Advanced
where is amrita university?
BITS Hyd, BITS Goa DTU/NSUT se to ek tier upar hi hain, I feel like DTU/NSUT is top of tier 1.5 rather than tier 1.
DTU NSUT thoda neeche rakh, placements utne acche nahi hai all-subjects considered
Kiit to list mebhi nhi bc![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30176)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193) (Kya matlab me wahi ja rha hu)
I disagree with commonly we should have 3 tiers, rest all should stay below
brother put coep and vjti in tier 2   
that's it's rightfull place it's just way overhyped   
and I am from maharashtra people taken admission there have told this
mujhe toh mera clg tier 3 lagta tha ......yeh tier 2 kese hogaya ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30168)  
aur bhai lnmiit tier 1.5 kab hogaya
Ye kis bhdwe ne iiit ( nagpur ,kota,sonepat,bhopal ) in bkl college ko 1.5 me dalla
This list has so many problems....first of all why is there so many tiers?
It doesn't include half of the decent colleges, ex: included snu but not ssn which is wayy better and even vitc is better than snu cus it is very new and hasn't even had any batches pass out yet.
That being said vitc shd also be incl in tier 2 (I might end up there![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193))

3.
Literally none of the TNEA colleges are incl which feels quite offensive😞 Anna univ and Madras inst of tech are some of the best govt funded colleges and they shd be in tier 1.5.
Still baffled by how some no name (according to me) colleges are above vitc (copium pro max cus don't wanna end up in tier 3 but kinda true tho)
This is like comparing only cs or top branches of said institute, changes with your branch T2 CS is better than T1 Mechanical Civil Chemical Metallurgy if we r talking packages
IIIT Delhi and DTU/NSUT are of almost same level..so either IIIT Delhi should be tier 1 or DTU/NSUT..both to be tier 1.5 (considering placements and ROI as the only factor IIIT Delhi should be an easy tier 1 considering a placement percentage of 98 and average package of 26 lpa..dont know how true it is)
dtu nsut ko tier 1 me dekhke khushi hui (planning to go there lmao)
Mits gwalior is considered good ?
Hahaha igdtuw itna upar bsdi wale kuch bhi likh dete hain
IIMS ke pi round mein 1st gen 2md gen iits top 4 nits(excluding allahabad)T/W/SURATKAL/ROURKELA
TOP 4 IITS(IIIT D/B/H/A) AUR BITS(P/G/H) DTU KO BSS EXTRA ACADEMIC POINTS MILTE
😂
Bhai should i go for lnmiit ece or thapar cse ya phir lower nit?
How is jmi up there?![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)
Bro mmut gorakhpur Tier 2 really?
Hbtu us real shit
Gow it is in tier 1.5
IISC is the best university in india, its campus is quite but scientifically it is very happening, also the nirf ranking ranks it best or varies among 1st to 3rd year by year and isro works with it a lot of times.
Also if we take world ranking then among the indian unis its highest ranked.
And the research is unparelleled there.
where does walchand stand acc to this?
Is there one for NEET???
No way srm is tier 2 its tier 69
Bro jab lpu jaise private tier 4 me aate h to mera 0 placement wala government college tier 69 me?
Bakchodi mt kr lwde
Add IITH, IITGN and IITI to Elite, they are doing great!
Bhai iit bhu is tier 1
Anyone know bout nxtwave college?
My cousin is planning to join this
MMMUT Gorakhpur above JSS😂😂
Other grits with good roi like less fees and avg 9-10lpa placement tier 2 or tier3
jaypee noida is tier 2 lmao
aur cu tier 4 bhai tier 69 v nhi h wo 😂
damn wtf i thought it would be 1 fsss
lol man low tier 2 nits are shit colleges in tamil nadu are much better than them
Elite + - Reyansh college of hotel management
where the fuck is VNIT?
including Hamirpur not Nagpur in tier 1.5 is a crime
tum log ne asli tier 4 nhi dekha
Thank God mai jis clg me lene ka soch rha tha mujhe laga tier 3 hoga 1.5 nikla.
Is this legit or no?
manipal cs is as good as teir 1.5 bits LNM etc colleges bruh
Aur main itna chutiya hu ki tier 1.5 aake bhi mera kuch ni hoga 🥲🥲
Every year I see this list and comment that VNIT Nagpur deserves better in the 1.5 list
Thapar is a Tier 1.5 institute, not tier 2
Tier se accha toh rank kara karo coz ek tier mein saare colleges barabar ni ho sakte like NIT Jamshedpur, Raipur,Jalandhar,Hamirpur IIIT Nagpur, Surat on par with IIIT Gwalior and Delhi is a dumb ahh take
sneaked my college into 1.5 lmaooo
please fix this list
Check aktu pvt college nirf data of placement then place them in t3
wtf where is iiitguwahati in the tier list?
Bro really put mait in tier 2 lmao what a joke, it's tier 3
Wondering what is the view on IIST?
Guys can someone help me ki biotechnology courses konse colleges offer karte hain and can I get them at 91.2 percentile?
Baaki ke IPU where
Amity noida is teir 2.5-3 
Other amity beaches are teir 4 

Telling this from personal experience 
Companies to visit amity noida but amity noida only
Bhai LPU aur AMITY ko Tier 4???????
![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)  
Amity and LPU should be above Elite ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Gonna repeat my thoughts from the first time I saw this list-

https://preview.redd.it/kytp05ult00f1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad5131f04a40fedd02e8de1e1963d74704b48988

Also "Elite tier" is such stupid wank, imo just do 1, 2, and 3.
Maybe 1.5 and 2.5 if you REALLY want to prove a point.
Cuz now it's just turning into powerscaling for colleges
IIITDM Kancheepuram is Tier 1.5?
It doesn't even deserve a lower Tier 2.
Where is IISc (btech mnc)?
IIITs ROI is good but remember fees in under 10 lakhs but placement is also around 9-10 average with low percentage placed(leaving the top 5 IIITs)
finally someone mentioned bhu as [elite.Me](http://elite.Me) happy now
IIT HYD should be in elite instead of BHU, no?
whats a polar bear doing in Arlington,Texas ahh post
me going to tier 69
VIT CHENNAI AND VELLORE ARE ALMOST SAME
Is thapar really gone so bad it's compared to vit, SRM, jiit noida???
🗣️S Tier- Reyansh Collage of Hotel Amusement
is iiit h really ELITE deserving?
how cooked are tier 3 wale ?
Should I take cs in kiet ??
Biet itne upar kaise he ??
bhai  abhi bhi yaha yahi sabho rhaa hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429) aur isbr ladki kr rahi hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30168)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30168)
Bc ye bits pilani Elite m kaise h..kuch bhi mtlb even bhu bhi
Want Prepladder, Marrow, or DocTutorials Videos?
DM Me – I Got You Covered!
If you have to place mbm university (jodhpur) in this list what will be it's position .just curious about my college where it stands out.
all iits and tier dick rider assembled here 🙆🏻
VIT vellore and chennai should be on same tier coz placements differ by only 50k most of the time and campus life is better at chennai coz it s a city not in middle of nowhere
Where would IIST trivandrum be in this list?
Bennett university, greater noida kis tier mein h??
Mera friend h vahan
jac delhi se cutoffs dekho dtu, nsut se jyada iiitd ko preference di jaati hai because it is better
the correct order should've been T1 : iiitd, dtu 
T1.5 : NSUT
you can add pes college in tier 1.5  
it's cs palcements are top knotch
I will say 
Accurate
Just my opinion but rv is tier 2, vit vellore etc are tier 3.
I think bits should be t1
MSRIT in tier 2 but no BMSCE?
BMSCE is competing with RVCE nowadays..
it's at least tier 2 ahead of MSRIT if not tier 1.5
I thought IET Lucknow was better than HBTU
Bc BMSCE bhi TIER-1.5 me hai(cse Atleast)
In elite nit trichy should be there and bits pilani should be in tier 1 cause of very high fees and packages are also similiar for cse students in iiit h ,nit trichy and bits and after that ju comes
iit bombay and bits pilani in same tier![img](emote|t5_311ttu|50130)
BITS is not elite bruh
118XXX rank in jee mains...
college suggestions please...HS Odisha General
Please suggest somewhere I can get any core CSE branch or related to it...or ECE max to max in some decent college...

Clarification regarding 75% rule
I gave boards this year from WBCHSE.
I have 81.2% overall (which excludes maths) .
I have 67% in PCM.
There is no improvement in our board.
I don't want to give NIOS exams.
My only aim is IITs,NITs and IIITs.
Am I elligible to take admission in them or not?

Isme drop le ya nhi?
Koi gaali mat dena bhay par Pata nahi achanak se mann kar raha drop lene ka abhi comedk diye h agar usme cs nhi mila then drop lenge.
jee mein first attempt mein 20 percentile aayw the aur second mein 50 (maine padhai nhi ki thi blkul bhi nhi ) and drop lene se pehle boards ke result ka wait kar rhi agar 75% nahi bane to drop leke kya fayda tab to backup college mein lpu hai hi.
But i really want to study the whole year and get atleast a good college lpu nahi jaana 😭😭

If u think u can study sincerely for the whole year then u should go for it 1 saal lgakr ache college mai jana worth it hoga imo
Shuru mein toh motivation rehta hi hai aur dheere dheere khatam ho jata hai but agar aapko lg raha hai ki aap pure saal consistent rahoge toh le skte ho drop
Agr drop lena hai toh lelo  bhale hi 75 nhi bne ho , next yr improvement exam dede na
College ke baad wale dreams??

Does anyone feel like jee made you not able to enjoy life.
Like every moment in 2 years you try something rewarding you always had guilt behind your head of wasting time.
You're a sweet guy, OP 💖💫.
Thanks for your kind words ✨️
bhai agar mera galti se bhi advance nikal gaya na (agar 15-10k rank aagayi) toh mein tujhe 500rs gpay aur ek pappi dunga ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Here is a small tip guys - Don't think that maybe you did not work enough.
Try to be overconfident in the last few days.
Man , how to tell that I hv not worked hard I jst wasted a drop yr literally zero improvement ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179) I am ashamed af![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
so basically I come from a upper middle class family, I studied for JEE giving every cell potential in learning and solving, my family also has sacrificed alot for me, I was clear about my goal I wanna go into IIT and i studied decently for 2 years, idk how the fuck my accuracy for badly damaged and I ended up scoring 94.67 in mains,   
I lost all hopes and kept thinking how do i jump from 80k rank to under 15k in adv?
Now when I look myself in the past and my dreams, I feel completely lost, I lost most of my things like health, friends, relatives  
currently I'm studying for BITSAT hoping to get one of the campuses with decent branch  
But IIT sapna hi reh gaya bhaiyon feeling so bad I couldn't pay back the sacrifices my family made!
already on the verge of giving up but thanks for sharing much needed tha ye🙂😭😭all the best to you too
That's the thing, i didn't give my all that I could have
Kya matlab qualified hu lekin fir bhi drop le rha hu 😭
3 yrs bro no hope for advanced bas jo hogya so hogya kismat mai hua tha mil jayega i want this to end i want to enjoy mere saare dost either college mai enjoy kr rhe ya droppers hai vo bhi enjoy kr rhe hai pvt dekg rhe hai aur neet wale the vo bhi ab enjoy kr rhe hai and im alone jo abhi bhi beth ke parh RHA hai halat ye hai ke mai jammu se hu toh even though war ho rhe thi mai revise kr rha tha 🥲
I didn't know just how much I needed this
bro, words cant describe how that felt..
Can u all tell me how is the lcm i.e., the time period equal to pi ..

sgn(e\^-x) to 1 ho gaya as it is always positive.
Aur min waala sin x ke barabar ho gaya jo doosre sign x se cancel ho jaayega.
So f(x) = 1 + |sin x| aur 1 se kuch farak nahi padega to period is pi
Bhai LCM to pi hi ha

Aise hee log, pehle jee mains ke baad drop lene ka sochte hai
Well even if she doesn't achieve that still its appreciable that she is thinking about breaking the long continued tradition of boys getting air1...hope you work hard and achieve it kiddo.
Reminder to all jee aspirants 

Jee advanced is the only exam which has never had a female AIR 1 till now

So Sisters try to break that streak 

And 

Brothers make sure to continue that streak.

I don't know why I fked the questions which I clearly know how to solve.
May be this was because I attempted the paper when I was really tired but I can't understand the main problem

Just ignore the ones jisme second thought aaye zara si bhi.
That's what I did during mains.
Even if the question seems easy, zara si bhi second thought aaye to just leave the question.
Pehele dekh ke heart attack aa gya bhai itna number !
Phir dekha out of 300 toh pata laga mains ka hai.
Was this a full syllabus one ?
Should I take drop or not?
I got 91 percentile in Jan attempt and 89 in April.
I was in top batch in my coaching(15 students, other batch had like 60) .
Teachers were sure I'll be able to crack both mains and advanced or atleast the former but I wasn't serious at first .I was prepping seriously in 12th but due some issue(friends backbiting and betraying me and stuff).
I lost focus and won't get a decent clg this year ig.
Should I take drop for iit or just go to some tier69 clg .
I'm willing to study along with learning some extra skills which might help me in future.
My basics concepts are clear(can solve most questions and also advanced questions if given enough time)..
Also elaborate skills I should focus on in case of either answers.

april attempt ke liye 2 mahina nahi padh paye toh ek saal consistently padh paoge?
not to demotivate or smt but agar kar pao toh hi lena
Same happened with me , though I am very confused whether I should take a drop or not...
>I'm willing to study.

There is your answer.
You have as much chances of clearing jee as the amount of truth and determination behind those lines.
Ask yourself if you're willing to live up to your words and not let yourself down.
take a drop u will do better but try to go to a coaching offline rather than doing online
Bro I went to Kota for my drop year.
At first I was scoring 200+ after grinding for few months.
But idk how I just messed up everything in the last months and again got 92 percentile.
Let me tell you if you're planning to take a drop year fking vanish off the earth.
No social media nothing.
Trust me this ruined my preparation and everything.
Literally slap yourself to study.
And it's best to take some online or offline coaching.
It really helps you staying consistent throught.

I failed as a dropper there is nothing left now
its 3:38 am in the morning and im writing this, idk what im feeling rn i failed at everything, i have no mental strength left now its ended.
i took a drop last year for jee and i was sure that iss saal to krna hi hai, went to coaching daily did coaching modules everything was going fine but then nov 2024 i started to procrastinate revision wagera sab band krdiya i thought ho jayega ho jayega and due to lack of revision and all jitna pdha tha sab kuch barbaad ho gya and then jan mein revision start kra but kuch ni ho rha dheere dheere mains pass aaya aur i started to have panick attacks raat me neend ni aati thi sleep schedule kharab ho gya i gave mains aur mujhe pta tha kuch ni hoga also i didnt score good in boards (less than 75) par mene socha improvement dene se ho jayega + there are still colleges that dont require 75 percent.
i gave improvement aur mujhe ni lgta kuch hoga atp i gave up mene soch liya tha kuch ni hone wala mene efforts hi ni lagaye i thought kuch ni hogaa well mains session 2 aaya and guess what whi same situation same condition aur mains 2 bhi barbaad krdiya, ik its all my mistake i gave up so easily i thought nothing could be done now but i had time to improve a lot and i wasted it by overthinking and procrastination, result came and its so baddd i could not get even a single clg with that percentile.
im feeling shameful to tell my result, mene khud hi sab barbaad krdiya just because of my shitty mentality and now nothing can be done i wasted my drop year.
also i didnt mention that every exam i gave till now, i used to call my parents and then cry ki papa ni hoga sab barbaad hogya etc etc and he used to tell me koi baat ni dobara padh lena esa ni h ki har kisi ka exam nikal jaata wo bolte the ki bina kisi tension ke exam dene jaao sab theek hoga but i knew ki kuch ni hoga, ese har baar rote rote i used to call him aur wo ofc frustrate ho jaate the abhi kuch der phele i called him mujhe as usual panick attacks aare the i just couldn't stop myself from crying and its the 4th time mein unhe rote rote call krri thi aur raat bhi thi to he picked up the call aur chillake bole ky hua iss ladki ne pareshan krdiya jab ni pdha ja rha tha to forms kyu bhare kuch pdhti likhti thi ni ab se ghar pe betho aur mummy bhi chillane lagi fir bola sojao aur call cut krdiya, i mean i expected this type reaction from them but i just couldn't control myself aur mene call krdiya its been 3-4 days im not feeling good esa lg rha ki ab kuch ni ho skta which is true, im feeling drained both mentally and physically.
now im just scared ki ghar jaake ky hoga papa kal lene aa rhe hain ik he was sweet to me just because mein ghar se dur thi aur wo acche se baat krte the, my father has extreme anger issues and now i havent cleared any exam wo bhot gussa h he's just not showing it ghar jaate hi im getting a lot of taunts ik i deserve it but i hope aur kuch zyada na ho im just scared ki papa kuch bole na he used to beat me a lot when i was in 11th and 12th i still remember all that i still have scars on my body socha tha ki clg mil jayega to ghar se dur chli jaungi but now im stuckk same situation me ghar jaake idk kya hoga aur mene abhi raat me call krke aur gussa krdiya unhe, i just dont wanna experience all that shit again im done, im just done with everything i hate myself for not changing its been 2 years and im stuck in same situation idk what to do now im not getting clg, i just wish to diee.

Bhai bilkul same score Same no.
Of questions wrong And skipped 😅
bhai neet ke liye met sir ko follow kar loon ?
Advance peeps, how yall holding up
Ima be honest here.
I didnt do much after mains.
Yes I have done some stuff specifically for advance but I havent worked even at a fraction of what I was doing for mains or before mains, in 12th.
I have this thing on the back of my mind that yea I have a nice tier-1 NIT with a circuital branch already in my hands, why work for advance.
Well it kinda did lead me to not working as hard as I had previously.
I havent given a single pure advance mock yet..
I have solved lots of questions but hey we all know question solving aint enough.
Im low on confidence.
Tomorrows AYJR gonna be my first mock, probably the last one as well.
I dont know how im gonna score in advance.
I am kinda beyond it at this point, just going with the flow, working as much as I can for the last 6 days I have got.
The time is such that if I try to enjoy, I am filled with guilt and if I try to study, I barely get shit done cuz I have no purpose in doing it...
anyone in the same boat?
TLDR : Advance close, didnt prep as much as jee mains, not confident, feel like ive lost all purpose, just in a state where I cant study neither can I have fun

Bhai Teri fir bhi bahut acchi percentile hai you will do good.
I think I regret studying for Mains 2nd attempt.
97.8 first waale attempt mei(cheater baith gya tha bahut disturb kiya, I fucked my maths portion) the 2nd mei 98 the(14 silly mistakes bruh).
I have Delhi HS(will proly go for IIITD Electronics)

Like poore 2 saal advanced oriented padha lekin November se March tak only Mains now I heavily regret it.
In 12th I was targeting about <2000 but abnahi lagta bilkul bhi possible hai.
Ab sirf top 6-7k rank mei aane ka target rakha hai.
Parents aur meri khud ki bhi expectations bahut low hai.
Also procrastination and phone addiction ruined me.
Now it's just damage limitation for me at this point.
Will still try to give my best there.
All the best to everyone who is giving Advanced🙏🏻
i self sabotaged myself again, could've done much better, yet here i am, sitting idly doing nothing.
Hardly studied anything since a week![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)

tera toh phir bhi sahi hai ki tier 1 nit me ja rha hai, mera kya hoyega pata nhi
Adv walo Kal ayjr derhe ho ya nhi?

You have only few months remaining with you, so you have to make out the best of them.
Delete all distractions around you, IG, YT - everything.
When some random thoughts, especially mentally disturbing ones enter, keep them aside.
Well, when a thought comes into your mind, play around with it for a while.
Ask the thought, are you really worth it to ruin my preparation ?
Let you parents money and sacrifices come into your mind alongside.
You will automatically get your answers and these thoughts will stop coming.
Another way is to completely immerse yourself in studies, just don't look outside or keep phone near you.
Go for 15 mins walks if you get stressed or distracted.
Meditate for 10-15mins daily to improve concentration and remove unnecessary thoughts.
Make new friends who are actually serious about cracking exams.
Its ok to leave old friends but remind yourself that they were disturbing you and you left them for your own good.
Addictions can be hard to deal with.
Use blockers and productivity apps.
Use a timer while studying to keep a track of how much time you are actually studying.
Stick some poster on wall to keep you motivated at all times.
Don't loose self confidence and self belief.
You have to battle with these mental thoughts and keep them away for this year.
Build discipline and consistency and you will surely do well.
Same bhai mile to batana
Concept samjh nhi aata na toh thoda force kr khudko.
Thoda interesting tarika sochna usse krne ka.
Maybe good teachers ho gye jese ALK ya fir ABJ yeh log do make the conceptual learning interesting.
Jis bande ne isse pehle comment kiya tha usne saare badhiya wale sources diye hai you can check that out.
Mentally you just need to aware ki sab ek hi chiz seekh rhe hai.
Bas farak hai interpret krne ka.
Dheere dheere samay ke saath seekh jaega 11vi m hai toh.
12th m hai toh just do questions continuously.
Maybe you skip one day theory but do qs all day.
That's gonna help fs.
Do good ones but.
Woh mains wale chote mote sawaal jab tak concept weak hai tab hi krna.
Concept seekhna hai toh sources diye bande ne.
Qs bhi achche hi karate hai woh.
Baaki extra qs sources:

Physics: SBT, thodi bohot pathfinder (zarurat nhi hai but ek do sawaal hote hai hamesha allen ke tests m etc etc)

Maths: Black book, aur cengage.
mathongo ka Adv DPP are really good as well

Chemistry: N Awasthi, VK Jaiswal, (JD LEE especially for IOC Theory is really good ik by experience).
Pdhai ko ego pe lene lg ja
Bhai tension ho rhi bhayankar
Bhai yaar ho gya mein jee advance ke liye select.
But revision sahi se nhi ho pa rha, alongside that abhi cbse ke results ayenge Kal parso.
Achha nhi gya I'm legit on the brink of failure.
Boht tension Hai bhai.
Kuchh sahi nhi jas rha zindagi mein, upar se Kal bc rishtedaar call krenge, mu mom is really concerned about family's image.
And they have done big sacrifices for me.
Bhai I couldn't live up to it.
I don't wanna see them disappointed 😭 I'm trying my best to study for advance but Kal se I'll be mocked and much more

VIT diya woh bhi nhi hua, comedk bhi nhi hua, IAT aur CUET bache


Jai Shri Krishna 🙏 
Bacha lo bhagwaan, mujhe shama kro

Wonder ki new students would even buy these courses after all this
Are iss logic se to mere offline coaching ke physics teacher jinke pass sirf 30students hai unke bhi 40questions to direct uth ke aaye hai ---- \[ kyuki padhaya to unhone bhi humko sab kuch hi tha .\]
Bhai ye ruk hi nhi rha, aura zero hogya hai lagra negative mai laake manega

Not a Neetard but ,
Bc 2-3 din pehle tak yeh ro ni rha tha ?
bhai exam ka ek week hogaya almost, ab kya prove karna hai 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I mean hr teacher sb kuch hi pdhata hai, sbhi varities ke questions krvaye jaate hain.
And exam bhi to syllabus mein se hi aaega, so what is this flex ke direct 40 ques from notes.
Yaa to ho last moment pe kuch 100 questions die the overall, un mein se match kr rhe.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Neither was my hate for Mister sir
2 yrs taiyyari isi liye Kari jati hai ki real exam mein kaisa bhi tricky que ho aur wo apki problem solving skills se solve ho jaye aur yahi ek deciding factor hota hai ek topper aur avg candidate mein 🤡 par lekin nahi yaha toh mere notes se itne que aaye uske notes se itne aaye yeh saal bhrr bol bol kr zuthi tassali dila rahe yeh log 🤡
Ncert walo ko bhi bolo credit lene Qki unke book mai jo likha h ussi se question aaya![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49466)
2 chiz ye online walo ki acchi nhi lagti 
1.
ye jo bhi bakchodi hai, sala sb leke baitha hai mere notes se aaya, maine mr sir se poore saal shiddat se padha and with a lot of respect, i don't have respect for him anymore
2.
ye jo 5 baje paper khtm hota hai toh 6 baje paper discussion leke pahuch jaate hai, bc ghr bhi nhi pahuchti hu and inka rr shuru hojata hai, bhains ki aankh, 1-2 din shaanti se rehn do fir karo na aapna kaam, students ko chutiya bana k rkha hai
how fragile can someone's ego be.
With all respect, this is pathetic
Kaash ye jee padhata toh kitna competition khatam ho chuka hota🥺
Bhai ye gaddha aur deep khode ja rha hai apne liye 💀💀

Bhai inko hi follow kra tha saare saal, course mein se padhaoge toh aayega hi, yeh kisne bola ki out of course aaya tha?
Tumne kya kisi ne us level ka practice nahi krvaya tha kyunki unexpected tha

Yeh ya toh cheap marketing hai ya apni ego satisfy kr rhe h
Bhai isse acha tanuj sir h us bnde ne jitna pdaya ginke 7 8 ques dikhe usne khud bta diya
Syllabus jo hai vahi se na aayega
Kuch sal badh khudki coaching khol kar bolega pura paper mera wha sa hie aaya hai

How can ppl even call him idiots im reading the comments of this post and ppl are calling him idiots.
He is the last one to prove that the questions came from his class notes.
Ppl trolled him to show where are the questions from.
Now when he is showing it is for fooling students so that they buy batches?lmao if his strategy was to bring money he wouldn't have come to youtube and drop 2 dream 45s and 2 full 11th and 12th most probable questions from last 15yrs.
He could have done the same only in his batches and asked ppl to buy those 😹😹.
These brainless ungrateful ppl doesn't even deserve a piece of him

I only studied electrostats and current from him and can surely say he is one of the best neet physics teacher not God or something but better than most of online there and even this year AG sir too focused on single line question and even in crash course prashant sir also given easy question blaming teacher is just a cop mechanism
Now it's very clear inko bas apna batch bachna hai
Does yakeen batch include offline test series?
Self glazing hai bhai!
Aur maano pw ke online teachers ko apna bhagwaan 🤡🤡
Jab ego jhant se bada ho jaata hai...🤡
Haha lol he said it was not the time to post from where the questions came but the brainless trolls did not stop accusing him for anything and everything he did😹.
Famous nishant jindal barked and used the opportunity to gain views.
And now when he and his team is proving that questions came from his notes ppl are again trolling him.
How toxic can these students be they will troll even after he did the maximum possible thing a teacher could do.
Ask yourselves and dont go with the trend of accusing someone when everyone is doing so.
indian army ek missile mr sir ke ghar pe bhi gira do pls🤣🤞💔
Mujhe koi ye samjhao ki jab ye log syllabus padha rahe toh usime se aayega na Aisa toh hai nhi ki ye padha rahe North pole aur aane wala hai south pole, ye kaisa claim hai bc aur isse koi ye accountability kyu nhi maang rha ki 5 questions out of notes bhi hai
This claim doesn't make any sense at all
Jo exam ka syllabus hoga wahi padhayenge na so obviously usme se hi aya hai 
Plus NEET me PYQs repeat hote hai and class me sir PYQs bhi karate hai so chances aur badh jate hai 
I don't think ye claim krne ka koi sense banta hai 
(haan wo baat alg hai ki maine PW ka course yehi claims dekhke liya tha 🙂)
Ye pgl ho gya hai
Saala future doctors ko dimension se answer nikalne sikha rha ja madarjaat🤡concept nhi bc trick aur formula lagao bangai physics.
Is liye to ma khudegi ha iske students ki is baar
Just stop bro it's enough atp
He should not even try to do this after knowing the level of paper that he have also not assumed while teaching the whole year that it is going to be this tough.

Bhyi most of the people who say such things are usually in 11 themselves.
They’ve just entered 11th, and suddenly they feel that studying from an "advanced-level" teacher will make them advanced too.
Then they start comparing themselves with those below them.
In fact, just a few days ago, a guy from 11th was telling me, Bhaiya, don’t study from PW, they teach only for mains.
Koi na bhaiya reality check sbko 12 m mil hi Jata

Can I manage Btech after 2 drop years for neet?
My background- I was a PCMB student and just got through my second year drop as a Neet aspirant.
I studied enough maths in class 11th just to pass( Hence assume me to be zero).
In class 12th although I had studied maths and scored a decent 86 in CBSE boards, now I don't really remember all the concepts after 2 drop years for neet.
This year I have failed to qualify NEET.
My parents are insisting on me to do a Btech in CSE from PVT college...
so I need some honest guidance about how much maths from 11th and 12th I need to cover in order to not face much problems in 1st and other subsequent years.Is there any chance that I fail in first year?
I don't want to regret my choice in future hence any help will be appreciated.
I have 2 months to study maths before the 1st semester starts and I am ready to put all the hardwork.

We should stop generalizing physical or verbal abusing by parents and teachers !!!
I am noticing that we all generalize physical abusing, after the post of that girl who got beaten because of neet.
everyone comparing that (mere papa to mujhe itna marte hai mukh nhi bola, meri mummy mujhe itna verbal abuse krti me to kuch nhi boli .).
infact we are also post memes about abusive parents that (aaj to papa g@nd tod denge ) why, save your a\*\* bro...

Help me( A failure ) out for College PLS !!!
Hello there fellas,
This was my drop year and I am convinced that I am just a failure I got 75%ile in jee mains which is 15%ile lesser than what I got last year yep 90%ile altho fK that I am fine with that my point is I belong to ews category (if that helps in my college) i also gave comedk which also didn't go well against cuz I am a failure I think I'll get rank between 30k-40k and yeah btw I am from Bihar domicile so please if you have any suggestions for college to me it will be a lot of help 

**Could potentially help me to solve this existential crisis of mine**

Umm 
Consider colleges with less than 15lakh fees for 4 years only as beyond that is not feasible for my financial situation 

Preference: honestly I am in no situation to have any sort of preference but still I would say computer science cuz I'll most likely be going down the path of coding ( don't have skills or talent : thanks to jee #IloveNTA ) it's not that cs is like very strong preference just make sure that whatever college and branch you are suggesting has at least 8LPA of median package ( median package is much better terms to look at what a regular student will be getting) 

If you are wondering why my marks dropped that is primarily because 8 out 4 months of drop year I was very ill( developed an incurable condition from that time for which I am taking medication till now and will need to take forever , don't wanna name the condition exactly sorry )

Alternately, you can use string constraint formula for all 4 pulleys
It's same as A cause it a solid one rope?
Or am I missing something here?
If not then Va=Vb
Multiple correct hai kya?
Block ki velocity u man lo, to slack nhi hone ke liye 5u=v hoga.
Then sabse highest pulley pe v of pulley=(v1+v2)/2 wala formula lagao toh point b ke just upar wala point ki velocity 3v/5 ayegi aur point b aur us point ki velocity will be same bcz wall wali pulley move nhi kar rhi hence velocity of B is 3v/5
use string contraint and virtual work done
Constraint ka use aayega.
Summation of tension×velocity=zero hoga
relative se nikal ayega.......
V pulley = (Vb + Vc)/2.....V pulley = -v/5, Vc = + V/5
Idhar hum jodo ghatao method use karenge agr tu pw main toh tujhe pata hoga

yes fischer structure bnao
Yes , meso hai 
COS present here
You check for R/S for both chiral centres.
Turns out one is R and the other is S with the same substituents.
One cancels the optical rotation of the other.
Hence it’s a meso compound

WHAT DO I DO????
So I applied for the phase 2 examination for the MET exam (manipal) for btech a while back and now the exam is tomorrow.
I went to download the admit card only to see there is none!
I did some digging and found out there was supposed to be a slot booking for the 1st or 2nd slot for the exam tomorrow (12th may).
Needless to say I hadn't chosen a slot.
And now I don't get an admit card???
WTF do they mean??
So I go through that long registration, pay the fees and bc I missed out on the slot selection they won't even assign me a random leftover seat in any slot???
I had to do it all myself and if not then I can't give the exam??
I've been spam calling them on 7 diff numbers for an hour now and only 1 picks up, which is recieved by a southern women who obviously doesn't give a shit about my concern and the accent isn't helping much.
Also WHY ARE THE OFFICES CLOSED JS BECAUSE ITS A SUNDAY?
ISNT IT A SUNDAY BEFORE THE COLLEGE'S ENTRANCE EXAM?
ISNT THAT A BIG DEAL???
I'm going to write emails to all the 7 offices that i've been told to contact.
Hope they see it or else I'll have to spam call them tomorrow at 9 am when the office opens and hope they give me an admit card that I can use for the second slot.
Seriously tho WHY THE FUCK CANT THEY RANDOMLY ASSIGN A SLOT TO SOMEONE WHO HASNT PICKED ANY RATHER THAN CANCELLING THEIR EXAMS?
huge L for manipal.
If some manipal alumni or student with connections in the institute reads this please give me some way to contact them.
PLEASE SUGGEST ME THINGS TO DO

Please help me out warna game over hai mera 🥺
im from punjab , they postponed my exam
Bhai they clearly said in the mail that without OTBS booking the admit card won't come nd no exam 
Anyway  try contacting them
bro, i understand your frustration but if you dont book a slot, how can they simply assign you some random slot?
you could have checked beforehand whether there exists a slot booking system or not.
and if you had registered, you would have received emails of slot booking commencement
If yes use android same happened to me
Manipal University Jaipur , Vit , mit manipal, Bennett....
Hi , I am a dropper failed to clear jee.
I am very confused right now .
I had given many exams like vitee( scored 1 lakh rank) , met (scored 62 marks) and comedk ( result not came yet but not confident about the exam) .
I also didn't perform well in boards scored 72.8 percentile.
Please help me for finding the best college for myself, I have seen the cutoff for cse (specialisation)branch in muj jaipur, I think I can get that .
I came from a middle class family, my father has told me that he can spend 30 to 35 lakhs max on my college.
Please let me know, what are the best options I have , or any other college other than these .
I really wanted to get cse related branch ( obviously because of the package) .
I wanted to know how good or bad is muj like college life, placement wagera wagera...
( I donot have any bad habit like smoking or drinking ) .
Nowadays many so called college counselor ( dalals) call me and my father for admission , they say they can help to get in admission in any banglore colleges and vit .
I really donot want to go with management quota , so please guide me.
I am really very stressed right now.

At least 75% in 12th, and top NIT's CSE would require 99.5%tile
98.5-99%tile gets you good branches and good nits
Generally 97+%tile is the lowest for any considerable branches in NITs (for open category, gender neutral) 
As per the paper, it wasn't very hard but compared to 2024 I'd say a tad bit tougher
so close, yet so far away

Starting NEET 2026 Prep.
Need Help Choosing Between YouTube Legends vs PW Yakeen 2.0 + Test Series Advice!
I’m starting my NEET 2026 preparation seriously, especially after seeing the level of NEET 2025.
I don’t want to underestimate it this time and want to start strong.
I’ve checked the subreddit wiki but couldn’t find a direct comparison on this, so I’d appreciate some guidance.
I’m currently confused between two prep routes:

# Option 1: YouTube Teachers (Old but excellent content)

* **Physics:** Ashish Arora Sir
* **Chemistry:**
   * Organic: NS Sir
   * Inorganic: ALK Sir
   * Physical: Sudhanshu Sir
* **Zoology:** MD Sir
* **Botany:** Tarun Sir or Vipin Sir

# Option 2: PW Yakeen 2.0 (New, structured batch)

* **Physics:** Saleem Sir
* **Chemistry:** Amin Mahajan, Sudhanshu Sir, Pankaj Sir, Om Pandey, Mohit Sir
* **Zoology:** Samapti Mam / Akansha Agarwal Mam
* **Botany:** Rupesh Sir / Vipin Sir

So, YouTube lectures are old but ofc has amazing content and teachers + gives time flexibilities, And about Yakeen 2.0.
its new, teachers also looks good but I am not sure about the content and time it'll take to cover things up.
So, yeah I’d love to hear if anyone here has followed either or both.
I am down for suggestions

# Other Doubts:

* **Test Series:** If I follow the YouTube route, which test series (online/offline) is the best which I should pait with it to stay consistent?
* **Extra Materials:** I use NCERT and solve PYQs from a free site.
Is there any other material I could use especially for Physics?
* **Maths for Physics:** Is it worth polishing on basic maths for like a month or two to help with physics?
If someone can clear some of these doubts it will be very helpful!
At the end of the day, I want to improve my basic + deep understanding in every subject along with NEET.
Because I don't wanna consume content from teachers who'll say "Mere notes se bahar kuch nhi aaya", I want a better mentality like "Mere notes se bahar question aayega but you're prepared enough to solve em!"

Thanks in advance, and all the best to everyone!

Advice Chahiye How to fix chemistry I am totally fucked
So i scored 97 percentile in jee mains.
I was enrolled in this school called Amaatra Academy, sabse chutiya school hian ye, they promised jee coaching.
In the two years of being there they never even onced solved a single jee advanced question.
Mere se with a lot of difficulty, jee mains chemistry hui hain.
I am really bad at physical, organic and even inorganic.
Advanced is supposedly easiest for chemistry.
I have 4 days left to give for any new theory that i can read.
I havent even looked / been taught any of the extra chapters like p block, s block, solid state, real gas etc.
Can some senior or someone please help me out in chem.
I will be fine with even 30/60 in advanced.
I know  till jee mains theory of organic properly.
One thing i genuinely dont get is how you guys are able to make reactions and solve them in cehmistry.
A lot of reagents i see that come in mock tests, i havent even heard of.
I heard about PTSA yesterday when i was doing pyqs.
(yes, thats how fucked i am).
So please please help me out.
I know im late but really, i want  some guidance or help.
How are you guys getting 40+ in chemistry i want to know.

dont take drop if you actually feel tired man, trust me, 1-2 mahina keech loge, par after that you will be burnt beyond recovery, will procrastinate, would maybe have friends to chat with all day, that would just ruin the year, only and only take it if you actually feel you can improve, if you don't, trust me, either join any private near you, or consider bits (there is a session 2 of it, you can fill that after 26 may) and of course, if you do end up taking drop anyways, take offline, but make sure you consider it before well and fine​
if you have average iq and not retard, drop year mein tumhe bas din raat padhna hoga to get a decent rank in mains.
if you are capable of that (not so easy to identify, people think they can give their 100%, but still get frustrated eventually), then only take a drop.
otherwise you will make same mistake of procrastinating.

Giving away PCB books for free
I got these books (plus HCV 11th class) from my sister 2-3 years ago.
They are mostly untouched.
Considering the level of neet this year, if there is any neet student who wants these for free, please dm!
Would love if these were of any use to a student.
I am from jaipur, but if you need the books to be shipped then I’ll send but you will have to cover the shipping costs.

Heyy Everyone,
I’m just starting out with my JEE prep and I wanna know something from you guys like 

*What were some delusions or myths you had in the beginning that totally fell apart later?
*Stuff that lowkey helped but nobody talks about?
*What would you tell your younger self (like 9th/10th grade you)?
looking just for real stuff from ppl who've been through it.
Drop your experience, even if it hurts a bit.

at the beginning of my jee prep i aimed for air 100 - 200.
well thats not possible cuz theres always someone better than u.
At the end of the day hardwork is all that matters.
consistency is the key fr , and thats my regret cuz i was inconsistent for a month or so and then my 11th grade almost fell apart.
if ur studying properly in 11th and if ur solving ur modules and dpps there wont be any regrets for sure.
id prolly tell my younger self to have fun lol cuz these 2 years arent that enjoyable , especially when you have fear of failure.sometimes at the end of the day i just wonder , what if i had put more efforts since the beginning.
i faced difficulties in physics , after center of mass , took me months to clear all my doubts and to have 0 backlogs.
what id say is no matter what keep no backlogs , even if u have backlogs clear it soon(dont neglect the other portions tho) and then life will be smooth ngl.
chill out for now cuz you gotta lock in soon lol  the difficulty in the chps will increase soon but everything will be fine if you work hard daily.
sorry for all this yapping too
1\] I was in the delusion that making it into IIT CSE is easy if I just study subjects daily.
2\]   a\] Regret too much wasting time on Quora in the peak exam time\[Jan-Apr\]

b\] No proper Mock test Analysi , I was just giving them just for the sake of giving them.
c\] Taking things moreover granted and casuall , always thinking that "Y  ,if I can't make it  to IIT this yea , I can surely make it in the drop year"

d\]Not actively study, I would just do homeworkforf my class and then after finishing i , i would watch yt /movie,s i.e no extra study.
e\] No network with scoring kids.
3\] They are not as such, still unknown; many people know of them.
In it, Mathongo, SBT, Eduniti, and Dexterchem are the real underrated gems.
4\] Honestly, I would give no advice to him.
I think he \[My Younger self \] should do what is supposed to be done by a normal kid at that age: play, explore , enjoy , study etc.
Mistakes are important in life and moreover, the experience after committing mistakes is a real gem which helps in later life.
I thought JEE Adv was really tough and my focus was only on mains.
But my coaching was advanced focus and later I found out that it wasn't too difficult if I just studied.
I thought chemistry, especially physical and some inorganic (chem bonding and coordination compounds) was always mug it up type, but it was also hella conceptual.
I though only modules and another book were sufficient but you still gotta do more material.
I thought I could solve everything available but its better to stick to one thing at a time.
Not studying for 12 hrs a day.
Not starting preparing for JEE Adv earlier.
Not solving HCV from start.
Not doin PYQs from start when teachers had told.
Not revising inorganic chem every week consistently.
Not making strategies for attempting paper in 11th.
Watching too much YT shorts despite of blocker.
DON'T look at any solution to a question.
First discuss it with lots of friends, teachers and only and only if you don't understand it then only look at solutions.
Attempt paper in ROUNDS.
Recheck your answers and improve rounds strategy (lots of YT videos available).
Be confident and have self belief every time.
If you don't understand a topic, struggle to understand it at any cost.
Try to cover maximum syllabus instead of skipping hard and high input things.
For mains - read NCERT daily 1-2 weeks before exam for IOC and some physical chapters.
Don't demotivate yourself with other's marks and make friends with more smart people and learn from them.
Ask even the silliest of doubts to any teacher or friend.
Meditation for 10-15 mins and 15 mins walks without a phone or anyone talking to you.
I wished I had studied maths and physics of JEE Level earlier.
Got 91%ile which counselling should I apply for 😭

Solve everything, solved examples also.
Don't look at solutions.
im at reso too and its solid for all chaps.
hcv only if u finished ur module
Use Allen module throw away hcv do only those hcv questions which your teacher gave you hcv is not a book for advanced even if you religiously do you can't even score a 60 in physics mains hcv was relevant 10 -15 year back instead do 2000 pyq of mains and you are well enough Ready to be 99 percentile in physics
Act of Result will be Considered Act of...😈

How do we start attempting such questions?
This question was asked in NEET (2016) and AIEEE (2011), how do we think about equating forces and doing the right differentiation?
If I were to be given this question, I'd start with substituting v or x in dx/dt=v or integrate v with respect to t to get x.
You can't get an equation for x here, and the equation you get for velocity has too many variables.

Write force in terms of distance x between particles (kq²/x²), and use the relation f=ma=m (vdv/dx) now your equation will be in terms of x and v as primary variables only

Thanks for this post OP!

IVF is a thing right?
So there must exist a timelapse that someone has taken of Fertilization and the actual formation of a Zygote and it's growth over a couple of days?

Should I drop or not?
Here are my circumstances, I scored 45%ile this year, a very low score all because I didn't do an ounce of studying, not a dumb guy, I can clear jee if I study hard but that's the thing "if I study hard"

My options are either take a drop and study and go to a decent college, or go to a college like upes and grind there.
I am very interested in coding and building projects (it started during lockdown when I got into gamedev and music production) but again I am not a programming specialist prodigy, just mentioning this because this is my interest and pcm fucked me up, but I have learned that interests change quite frequently and discipline is necessary.
So now should I take a drop after which I could land a decent college (even if not I could learn to discipline myself which would help me in college) or should I just go to a bad college and grind there?

In the drop option you should have specified the floor too..
Bhai if you are considering upes as option so you might think to take drop and get to decent one
my advice is -don't

but in the end its up to you baad mein regret mat karna ki le lena chahiye tha ya nahi lena chahiye tha 

kam se kam last mein sukoon hoga ki haan apni baat maan kar yaha hun kisi or ki nahi

Bsc MSc is perhaps actually much difficult than b tech.
But as you like it.
Bhai bsc karle jam clear karke chal jana ya koi competitive exam
aap log sabh mujhe bsc karne ke liye convince karna kyu shuru ho gaye
you can do bsc if you wanna go in research and academia others dont

pvt college like LPU or Anna maybe AMITY
College predictors use karlo also domicile mention karo tab baki log suggestion de payenge( I haven't researched regarding this, mujhe nhi pta)
I'd say attend counselling (try ur luck) keep the pvt colleges as backup.
CSE in pvt shouldn't be a hard job for u considering 2lakh rank
Upes aja bhai 24 lakh de sakta ho to😀
I wanted to punch trees

I punched one but my fist won't land 

I tried again and again but I somehow missed 

I was frustrated and I looked at the tree only to see it vanish in the air

I cutted it down months ago

But why did I tried to punch it again eventhou I cutted it down months ago.
Means - something bad happened to me months ago and it vanished in the past but it's memories stayed but they ain't real coz it ain't here anymore it passed and so my punches for the tree.

ALTHOUGH SHE GOT 591 IN NEET 🤡
I hate her so much 😒
bhai agree karti hu ki prateek sir top educator hai unacademy ke in physics subject for neet but bio ka top educator seep maam hai gaiz
bhai wo har ek teacher ko aise hi likhte hai, kya overreact krte rehte ho.
Watching shorts AND ads in the big 25 🥀
Bhai jo bhi neet crack karleta hai usse aisa kyu lagta hai ki ab vo dusra ko padha skta hai?
Bhai no offence but I would prefer vipin sir for both botany and zoology any day over her

Agar ye top educator hai to mujhe Phir bottom wale se padhna hai
She's the most bullshit creator in neet.
She gives major fake vibes.
Bc i watched this ad so many times but i never noticed she is rakshita.
areh ye tho vhi behen ki lodi haina jo thodi se bkl hai
Pw- we make teachers more famous & then influencer

Unacademy - we make influencers teachers and bacho ka chutiya also 🤡

Apne students ko cumpetition se bahar karke baaki students ke liye cumpetition easy kar rahi hai...
Kudh top nahi kar paayi aur bolti hai 720 kaise laaye woh bhi 1month mai😂
Bc iske poore channel ko unacademy ne apna adda bana liya hai 😂😂
bina B.ed degree ke how can u call her TOP EDUCATOR?
I will never understand the concept of teaching w/o having a teaching degree ( which most of the companies are doing)
Damn mai to bottom student hu
Yeh bndi sirf time pass krti hai aur kuch nahi

Aaltu faltu life story suna kr chapter khatam krwati rehti
Doctor bani hi kyu jab padhaana tha.
Iska matlab ye doctor bhi keval paise ke liye hi bani thi.
It's basically a disrespect to the profession aur bkl ek potential doctor ki seat bhi le gyi

Inse acha allen ke star batch vale bacche padha le
Pehle prateek jain sir Rakshita singh jaise youtubers ko criticise karte the but ab paise ke liye usi insaan ke sath kaam karna pad raha hai
She is one of the worst teacher I think I can ever think of.
😭😭 avg teacher hai agar ye cute na hoti to famous nahi hoti abhi
Bs issi vajah se iss brr I didn't choose unacademy ka batch.
They probably didn't realise ki jitne bacche ye teacher laaegi usse zyaada bacche will get repulsed by unacademy due to her.
Was planning to go with Prateek Jain sir but kuch videos dekhi maine yt pe iski recent waali , planning and batch introduction stuff.....Banda itna overconfident and egoistic hai...aise chutiye se nhi padhna mereko.
Going with Saleem Sir
I agree she is the best

Bhai abhi ye graduate gui hai , bhia utta free time Kisike pass nai rehta , sab pg ki race me busy hai.
yaar unacademy mujhe itna napasand hai, bas celebrities ko bula ke chochle karwalo.
Kisi bhi 0 experience wale ko teacher bana dete hai.
Pehle bhi inhone samay raina ko bulwa kar fans lapetne ki koshish kari thi.
Kya chomu sa edtech hai yar, thodi bhot seep maam sane lagti hai cause she had 7 years of experience from aakash south ex, delhi.
Lekin iske alawa sab chomu.
Unacademy ka main objective padhana kam, celebrity milking zyada hota hai.

No hate for her, she recently graduated and all, but inko top educator banne me kuch saal toh lagenge.
She has no official expertise in teaching.
Vo seep maam ki achhi hai bas.

Need help seniors for 11th
I just came in 11 and already I am having exams I'm not so good in financial condition to afford any coaching Or not even a person who could buy books at this point of time.
I know I have practiced ncert in everything but still these pts I found that NCERT is not sufficient for question practice and i lack resources.
so when I asked a lot of friend told me to go to Reddit and it seems to be consuming most of the time in finding the resources and I really want some perfect ones.
I need help in getting them here for me and everyone else and it would be really helpful and also what I found online was a website like offering tons of books resources for just 199 so like if I could get those all resources for free it would work or should I really buy them that's what I want to ask.
Luke website was digilabz ig i dont want to promote i just want to ask is it really worth spendin.

Bhai jo bhi cutoff hoga woh jab result ayega tabhi pata chalega, JEE mein bhi sab coaching wale speculations laga rahe the but final cutoff ne sabko shock kar diya...
abhi ke liye chinta mat kar, jo hoga dekha jayega![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
Then I missed the cutoff by 1 mark 😭😭
bhai mere bhi jee ke time mujhe laga tha ki paper tough hai to decent percentile ban jaayegi lekin nahi bani, shift ka bhi thoda luck kharab tha 22s2->3s2 but fir bhi competition is increasing rapidly, and it is indeed true .
jitna jaldi accept kar loge utna shi rahega.
me bhi sochta tha ki mere teachers galat bol rahe hai,meri percentile decent banegi but bhai unhe bahut experience hota hai.
aur wo mostly sahi hote hai
Jb jab kisine kuch predict karne ki koshish ki hai, unke laude hi Lage hai

Except anup daddy
Should i even do councelling!
i got 60 percentile, obc student, kcet also didn't go great 💀 since i wrote jee just for namesake im wondering if i should apply for councelling?
is it even worth it?

Don't worry paper hard jab aata h to lenient checking hota h..
last year mera set 3 aaya tha which was the hardest..
my strongest subject was physics and I was expecting 95+ in it.
After giving exam got really depressed kyuki Mera paper bohot hard thha..
and other sets were comparatively easy.
Mujhe lg rha thha 80 ke aas paas ayega..
finally on the result day I was amazed to see ki mujhe 96 mila aur maine total attempt hi Kiya thha of 96 marks
ig 13 th ya 14th ko aayega kyunki kal buddha purnima hai and 13th ko cuet
Most likely tmmrw ajye....
bhai agr phy me lenient marking ni hui to 75% bi ni ayega![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)

i love my school (no shit) i am telling yall that these sad excuses of coaching institutes wont get yall nowhere.
Even if i clear the JEE test..
these institutes deserve no credit, these mofos should be closed at the earliest, shit destroyed my gamin-hours ;-;

on my shitty first day i clowned the shit out of a teacher (bro didnt understand english) on top of that i wear PJs, Tees, Tank-Tops to the coaching everyday (i fought with the low-wage security guard asw).
Alien Institute’s impression on me was so bad i dont even attend classes anymore i just sit in the stinky self study area jus cus my parents want me to at least show up to allen.
I just gave 5 tests got rank under 7 in all of em so yeah.
as you can see from the above rant… i really hate nerdism.

Raat ka 2 baje ka schedule bnta toh mast hai...bss follow ni ho pata😔
Wo sab to theek hai but schedule mai morning mai kahi morning routine ka time nhi ?
No breakfast time ?
No lunch time ?
No time for dinner as well.
(considering you don't eat before cardio and workout) 
And hobbies ke liye bhi no time ?
And tbh , to clear JEE mains and advanced with under 10k rank, you don't need to study for so many hours everyday.
A daily 4-6 hours with coaching is enough, if you have the consistency, resilience and the IQ
batch of '26 here

being in Maharashtra board the syllabus is already fked up as i want to give JEE as it follows CBSE pattern and to make it worse, i almost have the whole 11th as a backlog(pretty dumb move) so i have to cover 11th backlogs then study for JEE and make up for my school exams simultaneously because whats being taught in coaching doesn't sync with school exam syllabus, i can try to cover backlogs during this months vacation but ill be caught lacking for the school exams, really confused here any good advice would be much appreciated

I'm from roorkee only, so graphic era is near from here, and many of my known are there, personally, it's a college of fests only they say, plus kaafi strict hai, placement isn't that good agar hoti bhi hai to, tho college life wise, it's beautiful campus, I mean it's a saying for dehradun colleges, beautiful campus, high fees, shit placement,but yes placement I think, depends on you, as there are people who got high placement from here as well, although off campus, or those who actually worked hard
only question practice in Drop year
I'm currently a dropper, 11th 12th me lectures kiye the aur 90%ile aayi JEE Mains me, ab mai lectures nhi karta, weak topics me revision karke DPPs karta hu, aur plan hai ki 1 mahine me aise knowledge gap kam karke sirf mocks and analysis karu, kuch log bol rahe hai ki mai galat kar raha hu, ki mujhe full depth lectures aur har chapter ke sequence me tough questions karne chahiye, yahi karunga to mera selction nhi hoga, I want to know your perspective kyuki jo bol rha hai uski khud 62%ile thi

“Struggling to Choose Between These NEET Faculty – Please Help!”
Yakeen 2.0 neet 

Hey everyone, I’m preparing for a competitive exam (like NEET), and I need help choosing the best teachers in each subject.
Based on your experience, who do you think is better?
Physics: MR Sir vs Salim Sir — who’s better overall for concepts and problem-solving?
Physical Chemistry: Sudhanshu Sir vs Amit Mahajan Sir?
Organic Chemistry: Pankaj Sir (PW) vs SKC Sir — and just to clarify, SKC Sir.
Botany: Vipin Sir vs Rupesh Sir — I personally prefer Rupesh Sir, but I’m curious what others think.
Zoology: Between Samapti Ma’am and (I think) Akanksha Ma’am — I prefer Samapti Ma’am, but want to hear your experiences.
Also, I’m not sure who the top teachers for Inorganic Chemistry are, so please feel free to recommend the best ones for NEET prep.
Your help means alot.

Bro i got 500 marks and 100 in physics so i DONT think im good enough for this answer but still i will answer 😋

1saleem sir.
I personally have watched few of his lectures and they’re good
 
2 100% sudanshu sir no further talk

3 skc sir is better than dm because ab organic mai direct ques nhi aye is saal

Bio toh idk
Thoda vent out karna tha
So I joined a coaching in Class 9th yess class 9th.
I didn't even know the stuff about JEE I was aware what IIT's were but not about JEE.
here's a story for all the juniors on how this shi is slowly killing me from inside.
Not gonna blame my parents maybe I was just a dumbass.
So kya hua ki since my relatives enrolled their kid into a coaching since class 7-8th my parents decided to do the same with me.
I didn't even ask for it ik it's not their fault maybe I should've said no.
But then classes shuru hui first due to covid it was online.
Acche se padha maine.
I am not academically smart or genius just a good observer.
Class 9th khatam hua.
My Chem and phy was good.
Aise hi class 10th bhi khatam hua.
Cheeze shayad thik thak hi ja rahi thi.
JEE pe focus karne ke chakkar me I fked up my 10th couldn't score much idk why mainly because I was not good at writing.
My self esteem was broken.
Parents bol rahe tujhe toh JEE clear karna hai aur boards bhi nahi ho raha.
All went downhill after that.
11th me padhai kari but wasn't confident about myself.
Distract ho jata tha and sometimes depressed as well.
12th me decide kara I will change.
Tabh maine acche se padhai kiya almost a year I'd say.
My calculus and Vectors, phy Chem, electro, Kinematics wala section was strong for some reason and usko maine Accha kiya.
Mohit Goenka sir ke ques lagaye the maine kaafi chapters ke liye.
Jan attempt ka result aaya.
20 percentile reason you may ask?
Mera PC band hua tha and I couldn't remove my unsure wale ques in Chem so usme percentile gir gayi.
April me I got 80%ile+.not a good score I am sure I could've gone 92%ile+.
Kyuki maine beech me JEE prep stop karke state exams pe focus kiya ig the best decision I made in this race.
Now everything is done.
Boards ka bhi result aaya for class 12th I scored 70%+ but couldn't reach 75.
Isme bhi parents disappoint hue....
And same wahi ki JEE ka kr rha tha fir bhi...
I honestly don't blame them they did more than they could.
Abh state exam ka result aana hai it went well honestly touch wood.
But unko tension hai ki I won't do it and that shi it affecting me.
One thing I learned from this journey that starting early doesn't always mean you do well.
Because I feel agar maine 11th me start kiya hota I would've been in a better place.
These thoughts I have never shared with anyone not even my parents I hope I take this to my grave.
Ik bhai kaafi log galiya denge ki itna hoke bhi kuch nahi kar paya but idk man I did take efforts but mujhe kabhi results Nahi dikhe not even a single time.
And kept moving on ki maybe maine hi effort nahi liye even tho it was my 100%.
Abh toh mental health inti kharab hai ki suicide bhi karne ka man nahi karna because parents ka khayal kaun rakhega fir.
I do feel that in terms of sucess luck wasn't on my side kyuki maine bhi ghisa hai bhai for a year almost 12 hours padhke but results were always average.
Anyways thanks for reading agar yaha tak padha hai toh

Suggestion to Juniors: Make better friends in life.
Those who want to grow and those who want to see you grow.
Don't listen to any relatives about your career even if they are super smart.
Padhlo Gadho nahi toh mere jaise failure ban jaoge.
In short from Chatgpt:

You joined JEE coaching in Class 9 without fully understanding what JEE was, mainly because your parents, influenced by relatives, enrolled you early.
Initially, things were manageable, especially during online classes in the pandemic.
However, trying to juggle JEE prep with school led to a poor Class 10 board performance, affecting your self-esteem.
In Class 11, distractions and self-doubt made studying hard.
You buckled down in Class 12 and improved in many topics, especially in Physics and Calculus, but technical issues in the January JEE attempt hurt your score.
You scored better (80+ percentile) in April but still not enough, especially since your board marks didn’t meet the 75% cutoff.
Despite doing your best and shifting focus to state exams (which went well), your parents are disappointed, and their pressure is affecting your mental health.
You don’t blame them, but it’s all been emotionally exhausting.

SHOULD I TAKE A DROP ?
**Hi, I’m planning to take a drop year for JEE and need some guidance.**

I got **94 percentile in JEE Mains**, and my **JEE Advanced mock test scores are usually around 130–140**.
I narrowly missed the **IIIT Hyderabad cutoff by just 0.25 marks**.
I also gave **WBJEE** and will likely get **Mechanical Engineering at Jadavpur University**.
Given how close I was this year, I’m considering a **drop year to aim for a better college**.
Do you think this is a good decision?
Also, could you please **suggest a good Chemistry teacher** for the drop year — especially someone strong in **Organic and Physical Chemistry**?
An **online option would be really helpful**.
Thanks in advance for any help!

wtf 130-140 in adv and taking drop??
on the same boat mann!!!!
If you're really passionate about JEE and badly want to clear it then only take a drop otherwise do not.
Because in the drop year every single student gets frustrated and do not feel like studying so make your choice wisely

It looks to be the end for me : [ I dont want motivation, but i need guidance only if you are 18+]
I’ve had way too many chances, and I messed up every one of them — from joining offline coaching in Kota and not making it count, to scoring just 60 percentile in 12th.
I keep trying to act happy and pretend things will work out, but deep down I know that unless I score 75% in boards, I don’t even know where my life is heading.
I’m almost 18 now, and honestly, I feel lost.
I’ve already messed up my past.
I’m thinking of taking a drop year, but it’s been a month and I haven’t even finished two chapters — crazy, right?
I’m not good at maths.
I took it because I loved Machine Learning, and even that I ended up ruining.
I’ve wasted so much time, and surprisingly, I don’t even regret it.
I don’t hate myself — because this self is still *me*.
But I really want to change.
I just don’t know how.
I feel like I’m stuck in this loop of wasting time and escaping into fake scenarios, which I hate.
I remember posting similar stuff last year, and even then, I screwed it all up.
But this time it’s different.
I have no college options left because I didn’t fill any forms.
I genuinely don’t know what to do next.
I love this subreddit.
Thank you all for being here.

Dude, let's unpack what you can do realistically.
Get the board results up.
Maybe work a little harder and cross the minimum threshold.
Once done, maybe try for private colleges.
With you current score, I honestly don't know how you would survive engineering, but if you do want to take a normal route to becoming a CS professional, you need to work harder and I mean way harder.
It's a tough pill to swallow, but liking something or just being interested in something, sadly, isn't enough.
Complex Maths is still part of ML fuck it's even part of 4 years of Enginnering so think and reconsider before you decide to pursue engineering.
If you create fake scenarios where you are successful instead of facing the failure and working your way up, I don't know what you will do.
So, chin up, it's not too late.
Think before you make any decisions.
Dont take a drop year, join in a remote college or somewhere, focus on skills you will need that in future

mains mein kitna mila
Rant on how I have been failing at everything so far.
I was promoted to class 12 a few months back.
I chose to study for JEE since class 10 back when I was in ICSE and started preparing for it after shifting to a cbse affiliated school after passing 10^(th) board exams with flying colours.
In the beginning all seemed well and good.
Since junior classes I had a very specific inclination towards Physics.
I had joined separate private tutors-who were the best in our tier 1 city.
After a few months of studying for JEE, we had our first major test in Physics-I came second in it with a close friend of mine coming first.
In the next test which occurred a couple of months later-I came second with him coming first again.
In the meantime I did fairly well in Mathematics tests too.
The only department where I struggled was in Chemistry-inorganic and organic parts.
However things started going south.
My ranks in all tests of all subjects whatsoever, started dropping.
No matter how much I studied, I could never score better or perhaps even cling on to my previous rank.
My parents suggested it was exhaustion due to studying for long hours, so I used to take nap breaks in middle.
Let me tell you, I used to and still solve Cengage(for all subjects), Black book, Allen modules, etc and when I am solving them at home I can solve each sum in about 4-5 minutes while more difficult ones take 10-12 minutes.
Now, things are so bad that I have almost given up o JEE and if this turns out to be a misadventure I might have to switch to govt job exams all thanks to the ICSE backed English and GK skills.
Currently, my situation is such that I can do at most 10 JEE MAIN level questions in one hour in a test or 5-6 JEE ADVANCED level questions in a test.
It does not rise beyond that.
I tried practicing with a timer by my side at home but when things did not improve I broke the timer by throwing it on the floor in frustration.

Can anyone give insights about KIIT Bhubaneswar now?
So, my JEE mains rank isn't so good (1.8L & general) but I hope I will get <8k rank in WBJEE but still I am quite afraid.
IISER de raha hu lekin I have 0 interest in research aur agar hevi toh woh bhi CS pe..
abb sabko to IISER BHOPAL CSE nahi milega naa..
So, my father told me about this institute KIIT in which I was initially not interested due to the current scandals happened there.
But now, in my situation, I am considering this as an option too...
I have heard good companies go there too and avg Package is very less due to the high student intake.
But after the current scandals, how much of it is still valid?
How much did the scandals effect the reputation of this college?
**If you are a student, please point it out.**

No need of values.
Remember values if you want of commonly seen metals like cu, fe (no need though).

First, I also used to cry about it, but I realised that it was only up to me to change and forget about others marks.
Analyse what went wrong and figure out where to improve.
Try different strategies, try switching order of attempting exam, figure out what is best for you.
Keep improving your score steadily.
Compare with your peers but only if you know you are working as hard as them.
Don't get distracted and maintain discipline.
i have been through it myself.
and honestly it affected me a lot.
i would say make friends with people who are around similarly smart as u and also determined in studies so u dont feel too i ferior but they are also determined so u still motivate each other to study harder.
i used to read and study a bit beforehand before going to my coaching so i dont feel like i m too dumb 

also know that it takes time to adjust.
all the people who are extremely well at studying might be studying from 8th or 9th.
so it will take u time to catch up.
in my coaching i was around people who studied from 7th and 8th so i felt like i wasnt smart enough whenever i was around them.
but know that no one is judging you alright?
it does take time to adjust.
it took me a long time before i caught up witj everyone.
you will catch up too.
and finding friends who motivate you to study with them  without making u feel bad are necessary.
so tey to find them.

too early n word
Why isn't anyone bothering to understand that we lost on diplomacy even after ceasfire agreement?
It would eventually prove that we aren't a superpower like we claim.
Had there been russia china or US at our place, they would've cared about the ego of its citizen and the msg to be given to the world rather than agreeing to a peace treaty.

guys...just came home after giving my comedk exam

and this happened

so papa was a bit late to receive me from the exam center, and as the no.
of candidates were less for this exam there were hardly any people left, meanwhile I spotted a junior of mine amongst the crowd, 

we know each other through being in the same coaching, and would sometimes exchange a hello,he would always greet me like "aur didi kaise ho", so back to the story,

 I went to him to ask if hi or any of his friends have a phone so that is could make a call, sadly they didn't, and he did perceived that no one has come yet to take me, we exchanges a few words meanwhile,like exam kaisa gya, ab konsa exam hai etc...
now the thing is that , he kept on standing besides me until papa came, a few of his friends were like tu scooty nahi laya kya?
etc, he said "ruko abhi", like it was so hot out there...
but he still was there ,I didn't even ask him..
i know this is not something big, but made me really happy, like good people exist, he is not even a "friend" of mine , but still....
small efforts like this does make you a gentleman

Then i guess i am a gentleman?
![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367) Honestly...good lad .
Aise posts ke liye main start hi end se karta hoon just to see if its a jk type post
He is really the son of great parents...
He is good boy
Even today I experienced the same 
This mrng I went to drop my mom to her work place and I was feeling a bit low so I thought to go for a ride rather than going straight home and I was driving the activa normally and suddenly it stopped I tried to start it again and again even I tried to get a auto to get back home then two boys coming from a morning jog probably offered to help they tried to start the activa even tried to start it with a kick then they said u should contact ur home I said I have left my phone at home then one of them gave their phone to me and I called my brother and asked him to pick me up 
Generally i get very hyper and I overthink too much that what will I do now if I get kidnapped or anything happens to me but those two boys made me feel safe and helped me contact home......
Wow mere saath bhi same hua tha, apne coaching batch ki ladki mil gayi thi exam ke baad, usne aake poocha kaisa hua, maine kaha theek hua, phir bike start karke chala gaya![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Kaash mere efforts bhi aise notice hote ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49464)
isme gentlemen jaisa kya tha
aisa to maine bhi kra  h 2 3 baar
I thought girls really didn't care about this, but I used to do it anyway, regardless of how much I knew the girl, I always wait for them to leave/find their transportation first, walk them there if needed.
It just felt right.
mai to ladkiyo se darta hu (except my gf)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
damn we need more guys like this.
Good people still exists
Happy mens day bol deti didi 🙏

Need suggestions on my drop year
So I am considering that I'll start my drop year with my weakest chapters then moderate and strong ones.
But there won't be any test series according to that plan atleast until November (time I'll be completing my syllabus once).
So should I continue with strong then weak chapters or follow the general sequence of NCERTs.
Also considering the rise in level of question which DLP tests would you suggest me?
Allien, new--light, pidablu, aksh.

Ncert sequence, or the sequence followed by your teachers.
Chapters are arranged in specific manner for a reason—they're interconnected to each other.
Both Aakash & Allen DLP tests are gonna adapt to current levels of difficulty, do not worry about it.

At this point you can't really predict your rank.
It can go very bad to good.
As per online polls and all a lot of students are getting below 500 or something but some are getting like 700+ or 680 something.
You can't really say anything tbh
just aise hi I saw  MR sir  2021 crash course today ....
thats what I realised.
SO im a 1st dropper and still figuring out ki physics ab padhun kis se kyunki yahan reddit pe to  sir ko tagda troll kiya  ja rha hai for various reasons and some people are also imposing allegations on him like ki he just teaches student to mug up things and do not teach in depth and blah blah blah...............maine sir se 12th ka electrostat adha padha tha pehle for context............maine aj ek chiz realise ki  ki  sir has drastically changed in terms of teaching style,technique and behaviour also....I saw 1 lecture of him today of 2021 and I was like ki is this the same person today...like he is teaching there while being so composed , cracking small jokes which are like fine at some point .......he was teaching with laser sharp focus and in  depth  without any faltu ki bakchodi which I do not know why he do in his recent batches now...he was teaching like his life depended on that batch ,,,notes were short as he was writing notes himself on board ,,concept was clear and there and things were going smoothly..........I do not know at this point that ki sir itna change ho kaise gaye ,,is it some sort of crowd attracting stunt which he is forced to do due to corporate pressure and god knows what..........ye jo bhi log sir ko troll kar rhe hain kahin na kahin sir bhi responsible hain us chiz ke ...he is not the person which he used to be  ,,like in that lecture he taught proper concepts ,,,compelled a viewer to think and then gave a trick with proper explaination ,,and as per me that is the correct approach to teach .....I do not know why he just gives a trick like a painkiller to students now so that they need not to use their brain cells even a bit .............I suggest jo sir ka pehla version dekhna chahate hain,,vo 2 lecture dekhein us crash course ke they will realise themselves ki hann kuch to bahut zyada badal gya hai sir me ..................................I just pray to god sir ka arrogance ya jo bhi hai ye is bar koi pw ka pr stunt ,,mere notes me se aya and whatever,,,,,sir bas is bar apne pehle vale style me ayein and bakloli ki jagah and crowd attract karne ke bajay sahi me pehle jaise padhane lagein to mera aur kai logon ka bhala hojayega........................agar sir is baar bhi pehle jaisa like in previous 2  and yakeen batches so reluctantly mujhe koi aur teacher dhundhna hi padega kyonki mujhse chizein magga mari nhi jati hain mujhe samajke hi samajh me aata hai..........I just pray ki sir bas jo reality me hain vaise padhane lagein naki again like any corporate puppet of pw .........you can drop your thoughts on this post below,.....

Bhai am a jeetard so dont know about mr sir and his teaching style..but the thing i want to say is ki tum kise se kuch expect mt kro..i dont think so ki koi bhi teacher apna teaching style instantly badal skta hai..it takes time..and tumhara career entirely uss teacher pe depend krega..so ye ek bahut bada risk hai to expect that ki vo teacher instantly apna level and teaching style change krega..online me itne saare teachers hai..do some research..ek se badhkar ek teacher mil jayge..and end me jab neet me 2-3 din bach rhe honge and tumhe kuch bhi nhi aata honga except for some tricks and paper ka level high honga to isme tumhara career hi kharab honga..and fir yahi teacher aake online video bana denge with the title 'Jo padhayada vhi aaya' to usme regret tumko honga..i am not blaming MR sir for this..pw ek crowded platform hai..baccho ko aise lectures dekhke maja aata hai..isiliye i dont think so ki koi change honga..to kise se emotionally attach mt hon..teacher badlo and unhi se ek saal follow kr..thats it..all the best for neet 2026
Mai Amit Gupta sir se physics padhata tha (the guy who used to own nucleus ) and yaahi cheez bola ki aapke aache teachers toh PW mai padha rhe toh unhone ek kisiko reply kra tha ki Im not afraid of the lions led by sheep's but from the sheep's led by lion
WHO TEACHES PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY BETTER- Amit mahajan sir or Sudhanshu sir?
For NEET, which one of them teaches better?
I have heard Amit sir does clear concepts and just give formulas and tricks, is it true?
And what about Sudhanshu sir?

Hey guys, so I'm actually a NDA aspirant but as fate would have it, I won't be able to join nda due to medicals, so I'm now shifting my focus towards JEE, I'm a 12th passout, this will be my first drop, and I was wondering which PW faculty to pursue, I've their Infinity Prayas batch so therefore I have access to khazana (i.e all the recorded videos of all the teachers).
I'm quite fluid towards my learning way, so if someone can kindly tell which faculty(from Physics Wallah) will be the best for JEE prep as a dropper for PCM.

koi toh bata do please maine jo det ke neeche likha hai wo det ke equal hai
Due to medical reasons (gharelu vivad) i left my 12th boards exam in December and went back home.
I took admission again in class 12th (dummy).
I am shifting to varanasi to prepare for JEE and 12th boards.
Which coaching faculty is the best, I am thinking of taking a dropper batch.
There are many, but which of them is best and completes the syllabus early and then focuses on boards too.
I also need help regarding rooms and P&G, 2Bedroom , Kitchen and bathroom will be preferable near the coaching institute, 1km radius will also be good.

Should i take a drop??
Ig everyone knows how were the questions this year well i won't lie i didn't give my 100% this year nd if i take one more drop it'll be my 2nd drop.
My parents are convinced i should go for one more attempt.
They are just so disappointed in me that i wasted their money for 3 consecutive years.
Anyone would like to suggest how should i start nd from where exactly.
Sidewise i m thinking abut learning trading nd freelancing cuz i m sick of listening to the money problem in my house.

There's no harm in taking 2nd drop with parents approval only if you're 100% sure that you will crack it this year (only thing is you won't get admitted in IIT).
And no one cares about how many drops you take but remember, during placement offers you should give them valid and convincible reasons for taking 2nd drop.
I'm very confused, hve joined pw last year bt didn't happen much, might be because I wasn't tht consistent, this year I'm thinking to join "ALLEN ONLINE COACHING" bt have no idea how's it and it's not that famous also...
Can anyone tell me should I join it or not?

GUYS PLEASE HELP ME REGARDING MY CURRENT SITUATION IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY😭😭
I'm a student of PW online currently planning to join Arjuna JEE 2026 after the results have been declared, as my parents don't want me to enroll in any batches until the results are declared.
But still, I kept studying from telegram(old arjuna 2025 batch).
But the problem is, in the old batch, physical chemistry was started from Atomic structure but in the latest batch, it has started from mole concept.
In addition to this, I'm currently travelling and I'll be back till the day after tomorrow.
I have 6 lectures pending in atomic structure, please tell me how am I supposed to complete that chapter.
Also, will I have to watch the lectures of those topics which I've already completed from the old batch in physics and mathematics?

My coaching sir teaches so badly I don't understand shit cuz he doesn't go in details and assumes we know higher level concepts!
Like I legit lost interest in physics cuz of him.
Am I just too dumb?!
I get so many doubts and if I start asking they won't end.
i get restless if i dont understand concepts in detail😭  
I wanna know how u all understood vectors apart from ur coachings....I am not gonna rely on my coaching anymore istg🙏

Chemistry kaisey karu bhaii
Sirf physical and mains se thoda neechey level ki organic aati hai
Inorganic mei sirf bonding and coordination
ek 27tard ne mujhe ncert exemplar recommend ki thi /s
I want to know iss bande ki hisab se chutiya kon hai bhai matlab

/s galti se laga diya lagta hai /s
Realistically speaking jo topics theek thak aate hai unke mains ke pyq + advanced ke pyq
Preferably determinants, matrix karlo, inverse trigo ke kabhi kabhi aasan sawal aate, pnc you can try and sequence n series
Bhai vector, 3d, determinants, itf, functions, vagera se thode aasan question aate hain aur agar 11th mein thoda padha tha to coordinate pnc bhi dekhle, vaise to binomial bhi kar sakta hai but ab time ke hisab se dekhle.
Mujhe to 94 aaya , pehle se hi advanced ka pole chhod diya
Ncert read Krle /s
Maths ka mujhe bata de bhai tujhe pata lge toh chem aur phy aate hai bas revision nhi baj rhe ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193) ek baar revise krunga toh krlonga

How did you all manage everything
Hi guys, Currently I will go in 11th standard and am targetting jee 2027 NIT surathkal/nagpur.
Now I know that jee is not easy even mains is not that easy.
After 10th I just got a gaming pc and now 1 hafte baad i don't feel like quitting gaming plus I also want to clear jee mains to get NIT.
Now I want to know that how can I manage everything like gaming to satisfy myself, studies, sports and sleep.
Do I really need to sacrifice my gaming and study 8-9 hrs everyday?

People target IITs in the beginning of preparation and then might end up in NITs.
in this jee journey most of us will see some downfalls & hurdles and those often led to gradual decrease in the level of goal we are targeting.
And you cannot carry more than 1-2 extra circular activity ...you've choose between gaming,sports,etc..
On top of that ...i'll suggest you to please increase level of your goal.
Prepare for cracking jee adv.
and then even if you somehow(like most people) fail to perform good in adv.
, jee mains won't be a that big of a task anymore.
And if your initial target will be a nit ...then there's a high possibility that u'll end up getting something lower than that.
And yes you've to sacrifice gaming(at least that's what i suggest)...for pass-time...choose sports over online gaming because gaming won't relax and refresh your mind for next study session.
Or may be in the starting of 11th grade you can give a little time to gaming ..but not in mid 11th and 12th.

Reliable news in general about current happenings?
Bhai mile to mujhe bhi bta dena...
i dont think there's any which is 100% reliable which you can trust blindly.
you'll need to learn to identify and cross check reports and facts yourself.
so I'd suggest to stay in touch with official govt handles(#1 priority), few news outlets, domestic as well as international, independent journalists and local reactions on X/Reddit.
Whenever some news comes you should see how many are covering it and also look out for local reactions it'll help you understand if its misinformation or true.

Reuters, Channels like DD are okay if you don't mind the portrayal of news with a slight bias.
DD still hasn't mentioned porki civilians dead as then it can be cited that indian government agency reported civilian death when the government is denying/claiming different numbers, for that reason, Reuters.
It's also the one most people use for MUNs when you need straight facts without forcing an opinion on you

DD news most reliable rn

DD, Wion, Reuters (UN ka official), FirstPost (tho, thoda sa biased hai)

I’m fed up…itne edits bc itne post….iit ka question aya is baar baords…cbse ne itihaas ka sbse tough paper bnaya etc etc…playing with future of students…huhh…LISTEN UP retards

That circuit question which came in set 1 and set 2 of physics paper was from IIT JEE 2002 paper.
Engrave this in your memory…jee advanced came into being in the year 2013… usse pehle exam hua krta tha IIT JEE…aur usse pehle AIEEE…jinka level aaj ke jee advanced ke samne kuch nhi tha…us circuit vale question jaise sawal aajkl mains ki kisi normal level ki shift me aa jate hain…ab koi in exams ke pyqs bhi nhi lgata for jee advanced

Even some post 2013 adv questions are easy as fuck.
They can totally pass as boards level questions 🤷‍♂️.
Some people just want copium...
How many of you are enrolled in Dummy Schooling ?
Here I my story of deadly combination!
I have given JEE (Session 1 & 2) 2025 and NEET (UG) 2025, with approximately 75% attendance in Class 12 and 52% in Class 11.
Still saying it.) Poocha kisine 

With all the formalities that a regular school-going student has to do, I managed to score 94.18 percentile in JEE Mains Session 1 (2025) and 93.75 percentile in Session 2 (2025) (i am a PCB student , 0 in maths ).None of my old school and coaching friends has qualified for adv (all have dummy admission)(Again, did anyone ask?)

Back in Class 11, we had a group project to perform a roleplay of "The Proposal".
I performed horribly (our teacher even recorded the entire act), and I ended up scoring 6/10 in the internal assessment.
We were also given an assessment to prepare a speech on "The Best Thing I Have Learned." I chose to speak on "The Power of Resilience," but again, my performance wasn't great.
For the Physics project, we had to make a fully working model, so we (three friends — 95% of the effort was mine) built an AC generator capable of lighting two 15W bulbs using just mechanical hand power.
(I can show the video if you want.) , we were given some relaxation in the Chemistry and Biology project requirements.
Entering Class 12, we got an English internal assessment which was completely pointless (our English teacher is a statue of obedience — for her, rules come before logic).
We had to record interviews with ragpickers and ask them questions about their lifestyle, work, support systems, etc.
Now, again, we have another Physics project.
So, I made an improved AC generator — this time with 80W output, still powered by hand rotation.
Midway through Class 11, I regretted joining a regular school and wished I had joined a dummy school.
All the strict rules we had to follow just pissed me off.
I left Aakash coaching in January 2024 (during Class 11).
Before that, my schedule was brutal: school in the morning, coaching in the evening — both 30 km away from my hometown — and I’d reach home at 10 PM daily from going to school to returning to home.
In Class 12, I became more consistent with school.
Still, our school gave no flexibility — not even for writing practical theory.
Everything had to be handwritten(no copy from Lab manual , no matter what.
My NEET score isn't that great — around 500 to 540 — so I’ll probably get a decent college, but I’m planning to take a first drop and give JEE Advanced on 18th May 2025.

**none .**   tbh go for private or iiit but ece is toughest branch agar interest ho tbhi jaana usme otherwise go for any other college and btw these nit are worse and civil or metallurgy mt hi lo , go for cse if you have less or no interest in any branch...
North eastern nits except silchar aren't very good in both placements and college life , jadavpur is good but considering metallurgy branch I don't know much
thapar me cse , jamia , jac delhi me try kr mil skta hai baki jossa ya shiksha se OR CR dekh lo
Bhai private exams ke form bhar ....waise inme se bas ju hi thik thak option h recession me bhi 7-8 lpa median hai metallurgy ka ( obv TCS  mainly , ab aise branch aur rank se FAANG toh milega nhi ) , baki colleges jo tune mention kiye unke under 5 ya close 5 hi hoga aur college life isse bhi shit hoga .....Lekin baki options pahle dekho private me , kyuki agar padhai me man nhi laga toh 4 saal waste hojayga

It was my first attempt of NEET  but since January my health started deteriorating due to which I was not able to study at all and after that I went into depression.
But I gave my first attempt this year which was the worst.
Now everyone is mocking that I did not study properly, you will not be

 able to do it, I have wasted money, etc etc my mental health is already very bad and all this is putting me into further depression, now I am unable to understand what to do.
I thought I should take one more drop and prepare but the people at home are not agreeing.
After that I felt like preparing for the PW secretly without telling anyone but I don't have that much money that I can take the batch.
I literally don't know what to do right now I am getting suicidal thoughts.

Any suggestions for an app to track my time ?
I am open to any suggestions except yeoplumto
so i am telling you my story at competishun .
in 11 and 12 i only prepared for boards .
i took drop for jee 2026 .
i enrolled their Praveen batch .
here starts the story .
FIRST Lets talk about the lectures first (my experience)

1.
physics facaulty - abj sir( good).
i could solve module, pyqs(jee mains)

2.p/i chemistry -alk sir (sucks!!
he explains nothing what he write in the board .
he thinks by rotting we can solve jee question .
For me he is like a book .
i was hardly able to solve module by watching his lectures and forget about pyqs .
3.maths - Mohit tyagi ( already had a bad reputation in reddit .
my experience was almost same hardly able to solve pyqs he teaches nothing advanced his lectures focused on theory(too much) rather than questions)

4.
org chemistry-NS sir (very good ) teaches chemistry till advanced level .
Now lets come to module , It is simple copy of old resonance module(not newone) if you solve it properly u can score 

120 to 130 in jee mains .
Doubt faculty is a big shit ,test series same .
they will only encourage doubt from module not from any other books .
I LEFT COMPETISHUN NOW

Currently studying from pw prayaas batch which is 10x better than so called adv content .
they scamed my father\`s 30k money thanks god i told my father  he is a maths teacher and understood my words and paid 5k at prayaas batch.
i am filling guilt that i wasted 30k of my father

Haven't lost the momentum yet but still
I am having issues while concentrating during practice 
Whenever I study 
My Mind is just thinking about some random stuff 
It's decreasing my efficiency 
How do I make my mind to only concentrate on practicing?
I have tried meditation it didn't work
So please guys help me with this one 
Thank you

You have only few months remaining with you, so you have to make out the best of them.
Delete all distractions around you, IG, YT - everything.
When some random thoughts, especially mentally disturbing ones enter, keep them aside.
Well, when a thought comes into your mind, play around with it for a while.
Ask the thought, are you really worth it to ruin my preparation ?
Let you parents money and sacrifices come into your mind alongside.
You will automatically get your answers and these thoughts will stop coming.
Another way is to completely immerse yourself in studies, just don't look outside or keep phone near you.
Go for 15 mins walks if you get stressed or distracted.
Meditate for 10-15mins daily to improve concentration and remove unnecessary thoughts.
Make new friends who are actually serious about cracking exams.
Its ok to leave old friends but remind yourself that they were disturbing you and you left them for your own good.
Addictions can be hard to deal with.
Use blockers and productivity apps.
Use a timer while studying to keep a track of how much time you are actually studying.
Stick some poster on wall to keep you motivated at all times.
Don't loose self confidence and self belief.
You have to battle with these mental thoughts and keep them away for this year.
Build discipline and consistency and you will surely do well.

If I give my time to you, would you promise to be true?
To help me get marks?
Cause I have done chapters before  
And I found that marks was more  
than just, doing theory

If I give my time to you  
I must be sure from the very first  
That you will give me more marks than it

If I trust in you, oh, please  
Don't run and hide  
If I solve you too, oh, please  
Don't hurt my pride like it  
  
I couldn't stand the pain  
And I  
Would be sad if all these theory  
Was in vain

PW App Users: Share Your Pain Points & Ideas for a Better App
Hey everyone,

I'm a student working on a UX (User Experience) case study with the goal of redesigning the Physics Wallah (PW) app to make it more user-friendly, stable, and helpful for students like us.
**If you are a current or past user of the PW app for your studies (JEE, NEET, Foundation, UPSC, etc.), your feedback is incredibly valuable for this project!**

Based on existing reviews, I know many users face issues with app performance, login problems, bugs, and sometimes confusing navigation.
But I want to hear directly from you about your real experiences – the good, the bad, and everything in between.
This short survey (takes approx.
2-3 minutes to complete ) will ask about:

* How you currently use the app
* Any problems or frustrations you've encountered
* Which existing features you find most useful
* Ideas for new features you'd love to see
* Your experience with the mental toll of exam prep and if app-based well-being resources might help.
**Your participation is voluntary and your responses will be kept anonymous.** The data collected will only be used for this UX case study to identify key areas for improvement and inform the redesign concepts.
By sharing your honest feedback, you're directly contributing to making the PW app a better tool for thousands of students.
**Ready to help improve the PW app?
Please fill out the survey here:**

More power to you bhai stay safe 🙏

Well advance should be postponed
Stay safe bro we'll pray for you
Advance most probably will be delayed given situation has escelated to a full war
Every face looks depressed and worried 🙁 Blackouts , Sirens and Blast Sounds Ferozepur me toh 3 civilians injured bhi hogye ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)

Email them I had mailed them plzz ap log bhi kro email llzz

Stay safe bhai 

Inta ho sake morning me padhlo and keep yourself safe at night
Stay safe brother, is there any way for you to get somewhere safer?
A relative who's living in a different state you can move to when the firing stops?
For now focus on your own safety first
Advanced will get postponed!

Tbh imo if anyone can truly recognise its potential and identify if jee/neet is for him/her or not…then he is literally gonna be toooooooo happy in life….bc pta hi nhi kya karna hai kya nhi
Unpopular opinion but jee/neet journey is mazedaar like I have cried literally for hours in my phone and my notebooks still have tears imprinted on them but something about it is sexy , like a Stockholm syndrome kinda thing for me
bhai agar apna interest side mein rakhke bas competition based taiyyari kar sakta hai to jaroor

I don't belong to any border states but mailing nta will help many students who live here
Also I hot permission from one of the mods to post this

I studied entire physics from him and mashallah he is the god of physics.
His illustration and concepts are out of this world(even better than abj sir).

Seniors, how do y'all manage your time?
I messed up really badly in the first test because I was too slow—I only attempted around 100 out of 180 questions.
Even after a lot of practice, I was only able to attempt 167 out of 180 in the second test.
Any advice on how to improve my time management?

The test is over and dang I did better than before

supportive parents hai par mai kaam chor hu
Fir bolte hai ki ladka apni wife ka puppet ban gaya.
Arre vo puppet nahi bana hai, usse love mila hai which you miserable parents failed to give or at least show
As I have said before  
For MOST indian parents, their children are not their KIDS, they are TROPHIES IN PROGRESS
beaten💀

mera to murder hota hai phir![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
My parents once saw my Roblox porn collection and I was threatened with a knife
This why many students dont want to live with their parents post graduation
i had watched this..
and man, her parents are traumatizing asf!
her mom mocks her every single time and when she reacted towards it, her parents thrashed her up, pushed her against the walls and what not!
and its been happening to her since her childhood.
her mom used to tie her hands and legs, put music on high volume and beat her up so that nobody could hear her scream..
but as of her, she's determined to become a doctor and is nvr gonna give up on it..
i just hope she continues to feel so..
aise atmosphere me to main na reh paaungi, bhaag jaati ghar se!
but thankfully mere parents acche hai..
arghh i love them sm
She also scored really well btw, then too this happened with her
Mera clg ho gya but when I failed my dad took me on a trip and said dekhi jayegi Jo hoga chinta mat le.
Supportive dad's are the reason I still have hope for humanity.
I just watched this video.
My god, Her Mother is a big ......
I can't get over it.
bro I love my parents 🥹♥️
parents have kids yo fit into society and do ts if kid fails to fit in it
Mera class 8 ke hlf yrly exams me Kam marks aaye the...
THAT WAS the 1st time my Pampa came in his real avatar 💀 
Uss din mereko KHANA bhi nhi mila tha....
Khate khate table se cheen Liya gya tha...
Abhi tak ( I am going to clg this yr ) 
Papa aur mere beech bahht Kam baat hoti h.....
😐
Then class 9 me porn dekhte hue pakda gya tha 💀
may god protect her
Mere jee na clear hone paad, belt, belan, chappal, joota, thappad kya kya nhi khaya, hospitalise ho gya tha, aur bas itne mein chor dete hai.
Shayad mere hi batch ki watt lagi thi
I feel so sad for her.
She should contact any child helpline number.
Last year around this time I guess...my mother told me how a girl living with her family as tenants in our neighbour's house was beaten severely by her mother because she failed NEET.
That girl literally had bruises all over her body and she wasn't able to speak properly.
My mother's friend saved her from that girl's mother.
Everyone recommended her to file a police case against her mother but she didn't.
All this made me and my friends so mad.
My parents said that girl's parents don't deserve a child.
Which is completely true.
I'm glad I have supportive parents.
Ye parents nhi janwar hai janwar i mean the girl said she couldn't call the police.
I get at the end you are fully dependent on them and you also did not think that things would turn out this way.
This looks so helpless but I request if she could rather should think of leaving her parents forever in the future.
Janam dena maksad agar naam roshan karna tha then mai mari hui hi thik hu
Edit: she removed her video eventually i just saw it 10 minutes ago.
I wish i could convey my message to her.
Ek hi to life hai usme buss khush rahena should be the motto chahe tum history ke teacher bano, hindi ke professor, civil engineer, nurse, hr jo bhi
She has removed the video, maybe for a reason so please remove this post.
Am scared what would her parents do if they find this video or screenshot
Mereko clear karne par bhi pel dita 🤡
Meri maut hoti hai maut.
I tried searching this video by Google lens and a youtube video link popped up at clicking on the link it is showing that video was deleted.
I just wish safety for the girl (I know they are her parents but still wish they do not harm that girl)
Hope the future generation won't face this .

Jb ki ghrwale ajtk kabhi serious nai the us chiz ko lekr(neither I had any coaching,dilaya nai) upr se my dad hates me(girl hu islye ..
and no I'm not kidding)  

Mine was 94 meanwhile one of my distant cousin (in Kota) got 97 ....
And now I'm constantly compared to him all the time
jo bhi ye post dekh rahe hai, bas ek hi cheez kahunga aapse

agar future me aap aisa bartaav aapke bachhon ke saath karne ki soch rahe hai, 

toh mat hi karo bachhe paida

aap apni zindagi jee lo aaram se, kyun kisi aur ko sirf dard dene ke liye paida karte ho
Then these parents wonder why their kids don't value them in the future.
Not all parents deserve kids.
She posted on yt it  could be even worse isn't?
If this is true
Kal agar he badi hoke maa baap ko bhul jaye to duniya bolega kitna neech ladki hai apni maa baap jinlogo ke liye waha pohochi hai unko bhul gaya
 Lmao
Parenting is not about only funding education, feeding and teaching manners it is also about caring, not being inhuman, supporting 🙏.
Mein jab high school se higher secondary school ke transition mein tha (9th-11th and some parts of 12th maybe) tab mereko lagta tha kitna less supportive parents mila hai yaar kuch bhi karu inko problems hai, bohot jhagre hote the especially with my father.
Ab piche dekhta hu to khudko gali deta hu mein kitna gawar tha khud galat tha firbhi parents ko less supportive samajtha tha.
I feel so sorry for her.
How could a parent harm their cute little daughter in such a cruel way?
Ab toh papa mere ko marna chorr diye..
Lucky in this case bhai maine 2 saal exam diye nda ka jee ka  but unfortunately wasn't able to clear them ...
Pr bhaii meri maa hamesha bolti h ki koyi ni next time ho jayega or , or kuch krle or kis cllg me admission le lio or merko etna regret hota h ki bhyii wha the hell am I doing for them...
my dad has stopped talking to my sister cuz she her neet didnt go well.
any solution pls ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
Man istg I sometimes hear people's stories about how their parents are, and I am in shock, like how tf can u TRRAT YOUR CHILD LIKE SHI, and then I thank god for blessing me w such a nice family.
the comments under this vid is even more heartbreaking.
I read a few about people describing their situation at home.
I wish indian parents were a lil bit more considerate
kaise mdchod parents hain bhai
Vdo dekhi mood kharab hogya some parents don’t deserve children
My mom tore my bio book last year but now after 3 years she finally gave up and is letting me do what I like (I’ll still go to med school if I get decent marks lol)I don’t remember if she tried beating me cuz I’ve learnt this tactic of shouting like a maniac and looking crazy (also cuz she used to beat me when I “answered back”) but I feel like this meme now and I’m also getting therapy for my potential adhd🙃

It happens with me everyday too but I get more threatened and abused if I tell them I'll take action and try to guilt trip me that they're my parents and deserve sympathy
Yeah bro,tbh bahut supportive they, people need to realise to earlier

greatful to not have such gandu parents
I’m 24 LITR preparing for CAT after zero work ex, undergrad from Amity.
Man such photos/ videos from kids make me realise how lucky I’m to have parents who LITR spoil me… and let me have hobbies, encourage me to pursue, do whatver I like while never ever being mean about it.
Mine father have anger issue but it's also very rare.
Either nothing or we getting cooked.
After 2/3 day of not so talkative phase after neet ,he said bkl khaali lecture dekhega to kabhi nhi hoga ,and that ki do if you want to or just say the word and we will look for something else.

Omgggg is she okay ?
Supportive parents hai lekin mai wella hu
Can't find the original video did it get taken down?
If yes then is she safe?
This could be very serious
Genuinely yaarr😭😭😭mere papa ne toh sabko neet ke bare mai bolne se he mana kardiya tha during my first attempt
He would come in my room just casually sit for long time and talk just to make me feel good
Dusri baar dene gayi toh papa ne bahar se he kaha just give it for fun it doesn’t matter this is just one of the many exams of ur life not ur first not your last.
Mere papa mostly normal aur understanding rehte hai, last year tak bas Mummy hyper hojati thi aur bhot kuch galat bol jaati thi.
Iss baar vo bhi chill hai lekin 💀🙏🏻
Class 9th ke baad mar nhi khaya kyuki hathse nikal chuka tha ladka

Ab kuch chumtiye ayege or faltu me apne parents se related krege ise 😂😂

mere papa itne disappointed the ki unhone 5 min hi sunaya mujhe aur wapas room mein bhej diya.

If isko getting beaten bolte ha to bhai mera to roj murder hota ha.

I'm unable to decide which branch I should choose based on my rank.
I won't be able to get Computer Science Engineering (CSE) in any college, and my interest lies in coding.
However, due to procrastination, I didn't perform well in JEE Mains, and now I have limited options for college.
Please help me determine which college and branch would be suitable for me based on my rank.
Here are the options available to me:

DTU:

* Mechanical
* Biotechnology
* Engineering Physics

NSUT Main Campus:

* Information and Communication Engineering (ICE)
* Biotechnology
* Electrical Engineering (EE)
* Mechanical Engineering

NSUT East Campus:

* Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)

IIIT Delhi:

* ECE with Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI)

Also, I will only get admission to IIIT Delhi if I score 70 marks in Mathematics in my board exams.
If I don't achieve 70 marks, which college should I opt for?

Can I get dental for 300 marks in neet???
Guys I hear coaching institutes say that their students who got 680 in all mock tests are getting 300s, so mbbs cut off will surely reduce and be 550??
If that's the case can I get a dental seat for 300 marks in neet 2025??
I need a government dental college and hopefully the fee is less than 5 lakh per annum

Is neet 2025 converted into a joke ?
Since few days I am noticing that neet 2025 has become a joke ..a lot of memes a lot of new influencer a lot of jee influencer are all over the heads of neet aspirants.As a neet aspirants I want to say few things to everyone and also want to give a reality check .
Note- don't abuse in the comments if u don't like it leave 
So ..We all know neet 2025 was hard because we were not trained like that .
questions might have got solved if we had more time .
People need to understand we are given 1 min for 1 question seeing the cutoff an aspirant mind is feed up with to do max questions bcz u never know the cutoff.people who are giving us 'gyan' specially jee wale they should know that their paper pattern is different from us .u are trained different we are trained different.hume sapne nhi aate h ...
Coachings centre being dramatic and emotionally fooling students..plz aspirants be aware don't be an emotional fool sab syallabus me se hi aata h it's just that we have to be trained in a particular manner .Koi coaching ko fark nhi padta h ki selection ho humra paper se rejection hi inki kamai h 
Ye jo tum ladte ho na teachers ke liye ..gussa hojaye ho kash itna gussa khudpe karte ..
3.Med influencers the biggest scam they are doing is glamourozing everything..sirf steth aur white coat se doctor nhi bante u have to sacrifice a lot 
Koi bhi muh uthake yt pe gyan dedeta h tum usse mommy bro bana lete ho bas ...sabke apne struggles h aese bechare mat bana karo ..
Sabki help karo mature bano to advise just don't be blind and support people even they are wrong 

I don't know why but I feel like everybody is joking neet as if there is no deal .The people who wanted to have a selection they have worked really hard for it don't speak bullshit not everything is a joke ..
People saying mehant karne walo ko no tension 
"Har mehant karne wale baccho ko seat nhi milegi" humra desh reservation pe chalta h "sabpe itne paise nhi ki wo private se karle ya bhar chale jae ..it's a reputed degree "

To all the aspirants and droppers who are studying for next years plz stop making a joke of everything focus on your studies don't be an emotional fool .select your online teachers wisely and work hard ...stop relying upon med influencers and stop joking about your dreams ...
I might sound harsh but no one cares its u and only you who have to suffer later
Hii I got 88.6 percentile i.e 167900 rank in 2025 mains artempt I am from Punjab and general category, Can anyone plz tell me what all colleges I can get?

Even i didnt get cse at vellore cat3 at 6.5k rank whereas the cutoff for last year was 19k.
This seat allotment seems a lot fishy especially that they never officialy release cutoffs.
my thoughts are this could be because vit did their counselling first .
this is why even who are capable of getting good marks in advance(who gave vit) have filled up the top ranks.
many wont join and due to the lack of sliding system in vit (unlike jee), if lets say someone from top ranks didnt pay their seat allocation fee (on 14th last date), the people who got later ranks from 20k+ who have their counselling from 16th will get those seats, (again this is due to lack of sliding system in vit).
Again i am not very sure, but this could be the case

MOST COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE for IAT/NEST/IACS UPST for 2026/27/28 [V3/last update] by your friendly research aspirant (maybe my last update post on this until and unless any change in exams)
# RANT FIRST ~

Hi everyone, my journey for iat/nest examinations was a failure, I helped my batch-mates, a few randoms, and a lot of people personally with as much as i could, to pass the exam.
My heart was filled when some of them thanked me and told that without you we wouldn't have been selected/ in a much worse place.
I just sometimes wonder what it would feel like to be on the other side of the dialogue (:

I haven't studied shit for iat/nest 2025 due to my hectic university schedule, settling in a new city far from home, all the nuances etc.
I am not saying that it was not good for me on a personal level, I have learnt a lot and have grown as a person since i left home, but now I am weighing it against my current state.
Whenever I tried to study i missed out on college life and vice versa, it took me 2 months to settle down, and the rest spent as i said above.
I didn't focus much on college acads neither on iat/nest part, both grinding against each other, as the sparks produced in the process only hurt me.
If i do get in iiser/niser it would be by a miracle and nothing else

This is 3rd/probably last post for research entrance exam preparation.
[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1efpvm5/no_bs_iatnest_guide_for_202526_and_other_research/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1efpvm5/no_bs_iatnest_guide_for_202526_and_other_research/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and the current part 3 below.
okay so, dividing it exam wise, advise for pcb/pcm/pcmb, 2026/27/28, and sources to study from.
PCB people aren't allowed for IACS UPST, All newly launches iit/iiser courses which aren't normal bs ms, and IISC all courses**

**2.
Course/Teacher reccs are your choice to be changed.
Biology i'd highly recommend to follow my suggested sources if you don't want to leave any leaks in your prep.
Maths choose as you need**

**3.
VERY VERY IMP:- IF BUYING COURSE, BUY NEW ONE OR IF BUYING PIRATED, BUY SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY FINISHED AND NOT ONGOING SO YOU DON'T GET GHOSTED LATER ON AND WASTE MONEY.
IF PIRACY, ONLY PAY FOR THOSE WHOSE COURSES ARE OVER/LAST YEAR.**

**iat:- scientific non programmable calcy provided on screen**

**nest:- normal calcy provided on screen**

**iacs :- no idea will have to ask those who gave it**

**EXAM DIFFICULTY:- JEE ADV>NEST\~KVPY SX>OLD MAINS>KVPY SA\~IAT\~NEW MAINS> IACS UPST(iacs also has a interview so don't undermine it)**

**SYLLABUS:- NEW NCERT ONLY, don't get confused.
Same problem last year where they uploaded the wrong syllabus but said rationalized new ncert.
2027/28 aspirants are recommended that they watch atleast long/big one shots of deleted syllabus just in case.
Especiall for pcm for both iat/nest and biology for nest.**

QUESTION SOLVING SOURCES:-

IAT:- JEE MAINS, KVPY SA, JEE MAINS, NEET HARD PYQS, AND OBV IAT PYQS, standard jee books/any coaching material will also work.
NEST:-  same as above + KVPY SX + NSE (p/c/b) pyqs AND OBV NEST PYQs

IACS:- IACS upst + mains + kvpy sa + neet pyqs

YOUTUBE CHANNELS:-

1.
Qubit [https://www.youtube.com/@qubitpune](https://www.youtube.com/@qubitpune)

# PERSONAL OPINIONS too ahead!!
TAKE WITH A TABLESPOON WORTH OF SALT

# 2026 ALL EXAMS

PCB peeps start studying maths asap, pcm peeps start studying bio asap.
**just be very mindful of boards and stuff!!**

Maths for pcb:-

Normal lane from telegram, just start preparing, choose any source, just follow it religiously and don't change.
(maths people please suggest maths sources other than just sciastra).
FOR iat/nest/iacs all 3.
Bio for pcm :-

Sciastra or PW NSEB batch(fully uploaded in all mods of pw), read the chapter from ncert atleast once before starting a chapter so you aren't completely lost.
Some of you might think of this as overkill, it kind of is but it's the most foolproof you can be if you want the most desired iisc or your preference.
NEST specific:- Extra stuff to be done like scientific tools (optional) can be done as there is often a question of biology for them each year.
[source 1](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlSarFol8A4Bb6bj_8xHGiBv_4mjq1L8B&feature=shared) and [source 2 ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJQnmDi4vK8EYwQvNoL_ySRU) .
PW nseb batch is for nest preparation.
Chemistry:-

IAT/IACS :- Mains level enough hai, please don't study from any neet teachers, Especially p@nkaj sir, stay away from teachers who prefer "memorization" in chemistry.
My suggestion :- AK lectures, pw dropper, normal lane, unacademy, iit school lecs if you can buy them on tele, any old recorded coaching lectures like allen etc.
NEST specific:- same as above, adding pw nsec and chemistry academy

Physics :-

IAT/IACS:- any jee dropper coaching.
pw, iit school, unacademy, normal lane.
You get it, if it's enough for jee it's enough for iat/iacs.
NEST specific:- pw nsep, adv courses if main level prep done, pwag, psjee, ambarish, apex physics, vinay uppal, insp, professor hiest.
DON'T BUY A COURSE 1-2 MONTHS before exam, you need a lot more time for preparing for nest

# 2027 ALL EXAMS:-

since boards tension is absent and we have got 2 years, **NO DROPPER BATCH CONTENT SHOULD BE USED.** Advice will be most same for pcb/pcm now as you should start studying all 4, if not now you would have to study all 4 regardless in iiser/niser for 1.5 years at the least as in the course structure.
This is especially for neet/pcb students.
Say goodbye to neet educators for a while(except biology for rattafication of ncert, still needed as you will probably be attempting neet.)

MATHEMATICS:-

IAT/IACS:- jee educators are enough.
Check above and comment section for recommendations.
NEST:- Same, but make sure that the teacher teaches all the way from very basic to adv level, Teacher recommendations to be made in comments by pcm students, tbh any trustable platform like unacademy is enough, but i will still refrain from making any comments.
BIOLOGY:-  
all pcb people should download[ campbell](https://filespayouts.com/hpm0retydix6/Biology_A_Global_Approach,_Global_Edition_(Neil_A._Campbell,_Lisa_A._Urry,_Michael_L._Cain_etc.)_(z-lib.org).pdf) and start reading it.
READ IT AS A ENCYCLOPEDIA, NOT AS SOMETHING TO BE RATTAFIED, READ IT WITH CURIOSITY, don't read it with exam preparation in mind.
Read it for knowledge, don't try to remember stuff, but to know what concepts outside of ncert exist.
I can easily recommend youtube playlists for all biology branches, but it's tiring and repetitive and you would get bored pretty quickly.
Those who prepared for nsejs/ have studied 11th pcm in 10th grade itseld should do the same.
TREAT IT AS A HOBBY NOT AS SOMETHING NECESSARY WRNA IT WON'T BE EFFECTIVE

IAT/IACS:- PW nseb, don't waste enormous amount of money on sciastra, not needed.
Just buy there cheap 1.0/2.0/3.0 courses/mock test series and use them for mocks and books with chapterwise pyqs.
Or to only and only study biology, and to be a part of the ecosystem and students just like you.
LIE ABOUT studying from sciastra and study from other sources.
NEST:- [CAMPBELL](https://filespayouts.com/hpm0retydix6/Biology_A_Global_Approach,_Global_Edition_(Neil_A._Campbell,_Lisa_A._Urry,_Michael_L._Cain_etc.)_(z-lib.org).pdf) reading method above, instead of just lectures for bioanalytics, we are gonna be using a book alongside, it explain every tool with the science we study in 11th and 12th.
[Bioanalytics book](https://filespayouts.com/hzt2onpnfphf/Bioanalytical_Techniques_(Abhilasha_Shourie).pdf) to be studied after at least half syllabus of 11th is done in all subjects.
CHEMISTRY :-

IAT/IACS/NEST:- Jee educators, more than enough.
Neet educators to be completely avoided!!
Anyways neet's level is gonna increase regardless as number of seats are same, and more population giving neet every year, more people score high, inflation increase, and as number of seats aren't being increase, the only option left is increase in difficulty.
Use any jee lectures for your study, and don't forget to read ncert atleast once.
I would recommend you prepare for adv level regardless:- INSP+INSC(if you can afford), unacademy, chemistry academy,JEE skool(experimenting hojayegi), iit school core, pw, any offline big brands like allen, vmc etc.
PHYSICS:-  
IAT/IACS/NEST:- I am kinda bored of typing the same thing again and again, so same as before, just 11th and 12th batches.
Oh and I would recommend 3 books for physics enthusiasts, irodov, krotov and pathfinder.
Solve them in the order.
Not necessary for iat at all, and for nest irodov is enough as a supplementary question book.
Teacher batch recs same as of chemistry:- INSP+INCS (if you can afford it's the best), unacademy, jee school, iit school, any big offline brands like allen vmc etc.
Also pw nsep batch for nest and nsea batch if interested in astronomy.
Standalone teacher for extra prep:-  pwag, psjee, ambarish, apex physics, vinay uppal, professor hiest physics

# 2028 ALL EXAMS:-

1.
buy nsejs course
2.
buy insp course for 2028(rich people option)
3.
Read books not for exam preparation but for knowledge(campbell)
4.
Take 10th grade maths seriously, you will be needing it.
Start 11th maths when nsejs course ends, sources will be told by jeetards.
My dms are open for those who have went through all 3 posts and still have doubt.
Why not sciastra as main:- better teachers available elsewhere, still buy the lower cost course for mocks, book, community and ecosystem, also helps to be in touch with like minded people.
IAT maybe you might clear if you are a great student, but forget clearing nest w sciastra alone.
In fact most toppers and even sciastra ke passouts used sciastra as supplementary.
This is true for all 2023,24,25 courses.
BONUS ANNOUNCEMENT:- Gonna start teaching zero to advanced biology probably from this year on YouTube for 11/12/iat/nest/neet.
Will provide study material of biology specially helpful for nest which is even better than that of sciastra.
Note:- Same advice to be followed for preparation of jee/neet/boards.
Just solve questions and mark notes of what's in syllabus and what's not

I am currently only using Master the NCERT by Arihant for Bio and i think it covers all the concepts from bio very decently tbh.

1st term of 10th matrix is 1+(1+4+9+.....9²) so by using sigma n² first term of 10 matrix will be 286 then for trace its a ap with common difference 11 till 10 terms so use formula of sum of ap and u have the trace
The diagonal of any matrix here forms an AP
see bro, this question can be solved in multiple ways, one of which is forming a general equation then putting 10 in it and other way is by manual.
The difference in the traces is the order of the matrics + 1, i mean it is increasing every time by 1.
so we can see that the first term of the matrix is 1 + n(n-1)(2n-1)/6 so the 10 matrix's first term is 286.
Then as we see the next term along the diagonal is 286 + 11 and so on till 10 terms so by sum of AP, it is 3355
Bhai terko pehle Seq Series lgake 10th AP ki 1st terms nikalni pdegi....uske baad bas +11/12 krke DIAGONAL ki term nikalni pdegi...aur vahan pe AP ka lgake hojayega
Is Thapar worth it??
Aaj Thapar ka last date hai apply karne ka 
I am thinking of applying but is it good??
Cos the fees is crazy high (around 30lakhs) , and i would have to take education loan so worried about the roi.
Based on last year's data I can get Computer science and Business system by jee and CS(main campus) through boards.

Thapar ka roi isn't that good so if u have to take a loan for it, I won't suggest u to consider it.
I'm not a senior but if you will have to take a loan don't join.
Your total expense will be 32-35L and you won't get a good roi.
It would be better to look at other options if it's going to be a financial burden on your family
Better go for lnmiit if u have above 95%ile
Im a senior just avoid simple
Hi, i wanna know what the pattern is and how difficult the exam is.
How would you compare it with other college examinations like VITEEE, SRMJEEE, etc.?
Also, is the official chapter weightage distribution followed?
Is it similar to JEE in any ways?
How difficult is Mathematics?
And is Chemistry NCERT enough for the same?
Where can i find legitimate mock tests??
Please help, my exam is in 5 days.

Need help choosing Career path
So I am interested in both Aerospace and Architecture and I think I even made it into good universities I only need to pay fee to confirm my seat.
Regarding Architecture I feel like there will comparatively less competition than other streams and it is also good paying job.
In Aerospace I fear that I might not be able understand the concepts so basically I fear that I may not perform well.
It also has many career options such as defence or aviance or space tech.
And I am interested in R&D field
I don't know which one of them has more reliability.
Which is better option in terms of earning.
What are other career options in Architecture.
Which one of them has more demand?
And also can someone tell that if UPES is good for Aerospace?
Also please share any other information regarding this topic yo think that I should know.
I am really in a tough spot right now.

ok so there is this interesting intersection between aerospace and architecture which is space architecture.
You can always integrate your liking in a field if u are really passionate towards it.
This may be popular in the future
bro first of all if you think of UPES as good university you are delusional 

and in india aerospace has less jobs and lesser salary your salary will reach 80-90k after 15 or 20 years of experience 

I don't know about arch though
A thing which helped me be a little happy
I deleted Instagram halfway through 11th grade.
Back then, I only watched funny reels.
But at the start of 12th grade, I reinstalled it for a few weeks.
As I scrolled, I noticed how everyone seemed rich, flaunting their luxurious lifestyles.
The more I looked into it, the more I realized most of them hadn’t even pursued good education.
After a while, I started feeling anxious, thinking my life was the only one that was struggling.
I then researched on Reddit and found out that most of it was fake—many of those people relied on credit cards and saved no money.
People there also advised me to delete Instagram.
So, I uninstalled it again, and honestly, it helped me feel much more stable.
Instagram can really mess with your mindset.
I used to get misogynistic posts about women exploiting men, and it was starting to influence me.
But now, since I’m not on the app, I don’t envy anyone anymore, and I’ve also moved past those negative views.
I understand that women face hardships too, and the models who earn by showcasing their bodies are just a tiny fraction.
Idk will it help or not just a tip uninstall all social media and be away from it.
till now I only found reddit to be good and discord a bit for fun.
Don't let social media to change your perspective

Allen vs aakash, which is better for NEET UG
I'll be dropping out this year.
Tell me about the fees, scholarship and other pros and cons.
I am pretty good in studies so I won't face problems of not keeping up or pressure.
And also tell me which centre is the best, or if it doesn't matter if my batch is good one

So I got 70 percent marks average in my boards but got 84 percentile, so basically I am in top 20 percentile.
Does that mean I am eligible for nits, iiits?

If you're not from SC/ST/PWD, no you're not eligible.
Top 20 %ile criteria is for boards, your board will release the marks required, it is not not for 80+%ile in JEE.
agar sc st hai to ho jayega 

agar nahi hai to chahe eligible ho ya na ho 84 par kuch nahi milega bhai
Hi guys neet mein pcb taken together 50 percent marks kya theory practical milakar count hote h?

I need help with CUCET and some serious advice, I know I am cooked
So I’m in a very tough situation.
I’ve wasted my 11th and 12th.
I’m thinking of taking a drop because I don’t think I’ll get any college.
I’m also expecting a compartment in physics but the good news is, I started preparing as soon as my boards ended and I’ve done pretty much most of the chapters except ray optics, wave optics and modern physics.
I’m hoping to take a drop to prepare for jee, not with the hope to crack jee but with the hope that I want to get a good college, and be able to give other exams because of my no basic knowledge over the vast subjects of PCM.
I’m also going to give CUCET and I’m planning to tick as many options possible because there’s no negative marking ( any tips to cheat, would really help me ), my question was also that if I give CUCET for cu this year, can I give it again next year if my plan to get a good college fails ??

Thoda information dedo plss
Hi guys, I will just move to 11th Standard now after completing boards from cbse board.
At the start I promised my parents I'd get above 90 but now I think I'll get around 80 percent.
Is it really true that if you get less than 90% you don't get pcm stream in cbse or Maharashtra board.
I am really scared as I am targetting jee 2027 and now I come to know ki I would not even get pcm stream.

Don't take maharashtra board u will regret ur entire life go with cbse only
it depends on your school.
my school didn't give science stream to those who got less than 60%
Ye bolne ki baat hai ki itne se neeche pcm ni milegi, thora baat kro easily miljaati hai itna stress lene ki koi baat nhi, boht rare kisi school me hota hoga but 90% school(cbse) me kuchni hota meri class me 70-60percentage awlo ko vi dedi thi

I am 2023Tard, I fked up all exams and was expecting to barely cross 75%, 

ended up getting 88.8%
Yeah 
I was expecting 70 percent but got 90 percent in 12th boards
During Covid , I was expecting 70 percent but got 93 in 10th boards
COPIUM DIVATES FROM REALITY
Yea was expecting 75.5% but got 95% moral- expect lower marks in boards to get higher marks ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
TS/TG EAMCET/EAPCET 2025 – Need Help Choosing Good CSE Colleges (Hyderabad-based)
Hi everyone,
I got a 62,000 rank in TG EAPCET 2025 and I’m planning to pursue CSE (Computer Science Engineering).
I live nearby Charminar, Hyderabad, but I’m open to traveling farther if the college is good.
This is my first Reddit post, so I’d really appreciate your guidance.
What are some good colleges I can get into with this rank for CSE?
Are there any private colleges with good faculty, placements, or reputation that accept this rank?
What are the best colleges for CSE in my rank range?
Which colleges should I avoid due to poor teaching, infrastructure, or placement records?
Would it be worth trying for management quota or spot admissions in better colleges?
Any tips on choosing between colleges if I'm stuck deciding?

Yesterday will talking to my cousin who recently settled in Germany, I asked her Abt the racism against Indians in foreign countries  and she said "I WILL CHOOSE TO TAKE RACIST REMARKS EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE OVER A CORRUPT JUDICIARY AND LAW SYSTEM ANYDAY".
And i couldn't agree more.

As if ppl in india don't discriminate and plus the judiciary, absolutely agreed with what he said
absolute W slight racism is way better than our education system and mostly unfair law
Same with my sis.
Also if u aren't the stereotypical indian, and actually a normal good person you wouldn't face THAT much racism too
whats wrong with u guys ye kaisa time hain to post crap like this have some sense
Guys how do people like "settle in other countries" like germany.
I am genuinely curious.
Like can you just find a job there, buy a house and that's it?
Or you can just buy a house they and settle?
What about citizenship, green cards, visas etc.
honestly asking because I don't see my future being much bright here adding to that the quality of just "LIFE".
you mean "while talking" not "will taking" right?
Bhai batade koi jee mein 35800 rank mein kya milega???

mere ek dost ne online plus dummy lia and he got 99.8...but he was on a entirely diff level..bahut hi jyada focused padhai pe genius type![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
this is good part.....
there's no schedule or time management....
if you have parents with non-science background and trust you cuz you were topper in school so they wont even check on your tests and all and on top of that if there's no friends around you to hang around with....
You are doomed to the last atom (personal experience)

Padhne ka mann nhi krta ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)
3-4 mahine Mai pagal ho jayega Ghar baitke..( self tested )
I am in class 12 preparing for NEET with dummy ( actually it's state board so you know) and Online PW batch.
I wake up at 8:45 and take 15 min to freshen up and then study for 1 hr( most important time of your day is the time just after you wake up) and eat breakfast.
Start studying from 10:40 to 1:20, then I go to mosque to pray to god ( you should also try to go to your religious place; as it  gives you mental satisfaction and fate) then I come home have lunch and start revision of previous day concepts for around 1 hr .
Then Classes start from  4 and goes till 8'o clock.
Just after the class I take a rough page and write what was taught in class.
Then again I go to mosque with my friend( also preparing for NEET ) and have some discussion and jokes.
I come back home and have dinner and again start studying from 10:30 to 1'o clock.
Either take online coaching alongwith a regular school OR offline coaching alongwith a dummy school, trust me; dummy + online is the WORST combination one can opt for, speaking from experience.
- fucked up social life 
- loneliness at its peak 
- burnout 
- high screen time 

And all these factors affect your mental health and then your overall performance in the exam + it's really hard to be consistent and disciplined all by yourself.
Jhaant padhai hoti hai.
Most of the time to loneliness feel hota hai

Zada banduk dikha raha hai
Bhaai , honest experience, 12th mein complete dummy Kiya tha meine , 1stly mental sanity f up hogyi , 2ndly bohot backlog bann gya , kyunki koi responsibility nhin lii jaa rahi thi , there's no time management, kyunki poora samay hote hue bhi padhai ni ho paati bohot procrastination hota hai ......
11th mein online+ hafte mein 3 days school jaana tha , tab sab badhiya tha , no backlogs+ syllabus complete+ good mental health.
Difficult hota hai yeh sab manage karna , prr complete dummy se better hai , jab Lage backlogs ban re hein tab 2 din off kar liya , but go to school ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30176)

Personal exp.
Se bol raha hun yaa toh complete offline kar lo yaa phir online+ 3 days school ( ending mein school jaana Kam krr dena ) .
Chahe jitna bhi mushkil Lage but go to school if you're taking coaching online.
Aur janana hoga toh dm karr Lena.....
2 saal online+ dummy, comments mai jo bol rahe hai akela feel hoga true hai pr acha hai koi bakchod nahi hoga time waste karne wala, ye 2 saal mai tujhe khud apni problems solve karni hai aur ofc teachers toh rahege hi , acha hai .
But plenty of time rehne se time pass aur series mt dekhna , class hui , notes Bana fir daily hw diya woh kar aur practice kar isi mai time chale jayega .
Air ek baat health pe dhyan de roj exercise kar , bhenchod meri Exam ke time waat lag gyi thi 2 saal bohot Kam bahar nikla mai , allen online wale kam time dete the, baki all the best,
Dummy + online?![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49429)Agar iss rashte pe jaiga to samajh ja tera khatma bahut bura tarike se hone wala hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
Jokes on you, maine dummy leke kuch ukhada nahi hai.
Jab Mann karta tha tab padh leti thi.
3-4 days rigourous study sessions followed by a week long relaxation period.
I hope you are strong enough to overcome all the distractions op
Offline coaching wala hu.
Padhta hee nhi hu 😎
Online + dummy hai too Library lele warna chud jayega
Meri puri 12th chud gyi isi kaaran se
bhai dummy ke saath online mt le 4-5 mahiney mai ekdam akela hojayega fir padhai bhi nahi hopayegi![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)yhi combo mainey bhi liya ab 12vi aagyi lekin padhai abhi bhi nhi hori![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|50130)
I was in dummy school last year (11th).
Ganda Vala chud gya.
Abhi 12th me dummy ban hai.
Bhai pura din ghar me rehna is truly truly NOT advisable at all.
Me pehle local coaching jaati thi and when i realised ki wo log bakwas padha rhe hai , I started studying online.
So me offline local coaching and online dono kar rhi thi.
merko esa lag rha tha ki offline me sirf time bigad rha hai etc aur end me mene offline jaana hi band kr diya tha.
and TRUST me , pura din ghar me rehke i really did fuck my mental health!.
doesn't matter if you're a topper ( which i was ) , or you have great self control or discipline , it's all gonna come to an end one day.
you're gonna NEED to interact with friends and go out a little.
so yes, then I realised ki offline jaane ki vajah se my mental health was kept stable and healthy .
So if you're gonna do complete online , make sure to have a good STUDY PARTNER to keep you on track.
make sure to relax and be consistent.
wake up at 8 am , procrastinating till 3 am (masturbating 2 times ) sleep 4 to 5 hrs , repeat.(dummy mat le Bhai)
kuch nhi bhai dekh, subah se shaam tak padhta hun, like beech beech mein thoda khana vgere ka break leke, simple, jitna Kam time waste karega utna hi accha uske liye kuch schedule ki jarurat whatsoever hai hi nhi :)
Dummy is not recommended (saying from personal experience)
its not easy bhai.
i usually dont get to exp leisure hours.
Dummy + online has to be the worst combo mai pehle he bata ri kuch ek offline rakho pagal ho jaoge warna
Bhai last ek saal se ghar pe hu online student ,  choti choti cheezon mein khusiyan dhunde laga hu 😭, Bhai hafte mein 1-2 din toh school chale jaana warne chud jayega 🙏.
Dimaag ka bhosda ho jata hai Ghar pe baithe baithe .
Aur agar bohot bohot bohot strong determination nhi hai exam nikalne ki toh hi online opt mat  Krna ..
chup chap offline nikal ja ..
discipline nhi rehta online mein .
After reading all the comments I can finnally conclude


I'm fked up
That's the catch, they don't
advice dont do it u will be devlop social anxiety
Idk man I'm thinking of going to school+ online coaching cause uhh I don't have strength for going to offline coaching and school 😭🙏🏿 but social interaction is important bro week Mai 1-2 days toh sick leave application dedo aur kuch nhi
kyu batau be ye kya jor jabardasti h be sale 😡😡
heh whats that whats a time schedule

Where to sell my aakash modules?
I tried OLX but got no response,
And if I try to contact with neet aspirants in my family or friends, they ask them for free.
These are my drop year books with are totally fresh, as I kept using my XI+XII modules itself in my drop year.
If you know any platform then please do comment,
And what price should I set them at?

No response on olx from small town
So apparently my degree doesn’t matter because I’m a girl and 'some dude will always wanna fuck me'?
Bro Let me introduce you to 2025!!!!
My mom works - that also not out of compulsion but out of choice.
She provides for us just like any hardworking individual 

Shocking for you?
I know

Also, I’m the eldest of two daughters and my parents?
Never once wished for a son.
And to that crying about how 'men have it tough' while dragging women for existing—maybe, just maybe, the world isn’t hard on you because you’re a man.
It’s hard on you because you’re mediocre, average and insecure 

Imagine being so insecure over a sweet text you gotta dongrade women to feel better?
I feel sorry for such people who dont get such love from their parents 

Didn’t know we still had guys out here stuck in the 90s with this kind of garbage mindset.
These are the kind of guys who when grow up in their 20s and 30s continue the crap, continue spreading these toxic ideas and thus the chain never breaks

*Pointing this out not to demean him, but because it's high time we let go these shits*

Girl that wasn't his first time
He is baiting, dont fall in his bait
Stop giving attention to these obvious rage baiters.
These fuckers will say this shit and whine about their wives 'doing nothing at home while hes working'

Let this dude be in his miserable manosphere, hes clearly too moronic to look at how the real world operates...
there are billions of working women in the world and the number keeps increasing as more women in traditional countries stand up for themselves to work.
You are impressive, dont let fools like this bring you down...
this may be bait but many actually are like this
Recently had a breakdown and shared a sweet message my mom sent me.
Somehow people jumped to worst case scenarios 

And then this guy decided to comment on that with this.
JUST FOR THE CONTEXT: Scored 98.7 in JM, UGEE: selected for interview 
No flex, not the topper but def not the failure
unpopular thought(unpopular after looking at people like this)   
one of the most attractive things about someone is when they have a focused goal, work towards it and gen give a fuck about their career they work towards it (im not saying work 24/7) but like they give a fuck and dont have a laid back attitude
No girl is doing a degree, to fulfill what 'man prefers'.
In fact, thats some mens fantasy to study hard to get a girl.
And often the girl is forced to sit at home after marriage, not one desires about it.
Reason to leave reddit
bro these are just insecure mess of men, who are afraid that women could be equals or better, stilll living in the stereotypical, patriarchal and shallow mindset.
Can't believe in this day and age we have people who think the entire purpose of an individual's life is to "be desirable to the opposite sex" Fucking cringe.
I also hate it when people around me comment that "Aisi harkate karte rahega toh koi ladki nhi milegi" Genuinely cringe people.
If I get a girl I'd want her to love me for who I am.
If a life partner is ur entire goal in life then don't assume that dusre log bhi tumhare tara hain.
A man's life is not toughee than that of a woman.
An academically blessed person's life is not easier than that of a challenges guy.
The day you stop believing in such stereotypes you'll truly liberate yourself and find your wings.
So just stop comparing live and let live.
His user name is true for him.
as a guy whose mom is the one doing everything, working a job to support her family, providing everything for me that i have ever asked her.
sincerely, fuck this guy.
Bery dangerus pepol hehe
pta hai aise logo ko sidha madarchod bolo fir uss area ke hijdo se uthva ke gende ke gaand mein dalwa do
Ragebait hai don't worry OP.
Chill out ya are good
Lets see if he gets Civil in any NIT...
The facts are true  
But the application is not  
1.Most people will choose as he says  
 But all those people are people he knows, the ones who will choose a smart girl will never had assosciated with  him before, so he doesn't know they exist

2.The one paying for a woman's life choices is probably her father  
   But that only applies to the women who assosciate with him, not people like you

My mother has a quotation which I always remember  
"If you throw a pebble on dung in your way, dung will fall on you.
It is YOUR responsibility to walk around the dung"(native language to english, so translate might seem a bit off, goes hard in telugu)
Sometimes is very easy to identify how women are treated in some households.
He must have seen how his father treats his mother and sister and that's what has shaped his ideology I feel.
It's better to not even get into arguments with these kinds you wouldn't be able to change their ideology but they would probably 🦆 your mental peace.
Trust me, no sane guy wants "a hot girl with no qualifications" I left my ex beacuse I didn't see purpose in her, she didn't have any goals or ambitions, which made the relationship boring for me.
I'd much rather be with someone who wants to make something of herself.
Go chase your dreams op, don't ever listen to insecure men who can't see you be more successful than them.
Congratulations for the percentile and ugee!
You'll find such fuckers everywhere, insecure incels....He mad cuz he ain't you, you've achieved what he wished to achieve....I am proud of you, ignore that dumbass
Bro is a professional incel😭🙏🏻
I thinl he wanrs dowmvotes
stupid people, ignore them aage badho inke opinions matter nhi krte
Honestly, it's become nearly impossible for women who don't work nowadays to get married tbh.
With the cost of living increasing day by day, men prefer to marry a woman who CAN PROVIDE and has a JOB.
What is this dude on about?
And this isn't even about marriage wtf working is a personal choice
thats a messed up ragebait to begin with.
Even if his intention was to bait op, thats just bizarre.
He speaks to his mother with that tongue?
just say sybau and move on
You really don’t have to proof any fucking thing to anyone other than your parents these type of guys are the one who can’t do anything in their lives and them blame girls 
Incels
just ignore such mfs
Give him a tight slap and choose your seat via Gender Neutral 🥰🥰 (If u can)
He is just an insecure man who gets no women .....
Ignore him he is not worth ur time
Don't interact with these accounts it is pure bait
i won't comment on this, my opinion lies in between of extreme ends,  
but this comment is just down bad

Shyd uske andr frustration hogyi h vo frustration bolri h or ye frustration society hi deti h , maybe i am wrong Just giving another perspective to think ye civil or biotech vali baat pr , fuck vali baat to glt hi h
Ur wrong btw , a man’s life is much harder than a woman’s life , men really have it tough
i agree with him.
girls can be housewives, but have u ever seen any "househusband"?
Well one thing for sure, guys are less coddled in general.
If you don't know that then you lost the plot
With respect to India and the patriarchy present here 
He is right 



But excluding India and manlo u go outside for job etc
You are right and he's wrong
Somewhere in a educated state like Kerala, atleast, this holds true for a good chunk of people if not all.
Just because you only see the proud one in internet doesnt mean others dont exist.
Atleast their mentality isnt progressive like what independent girls show traits of.

Why do you want the  list...Research on the colleges on your own that you are getting...see placemnets stats , talk to passouts, go to their subreddit
bhai mit manipal is way better thn jaypee hbtu also cse is much better than some of the NITs
Who tf even decides tier of clges
Bhai is tier wier ke chakkar mein mat pad, see the one which has a good location good campus good placements and a decent roi, wahi chala jaa
NITs are over rated

Guys amity Noida ka kya tier 🤡🤡
tier list se kuch nahi hota, humare tier elite waale colleges singapore and usa ke tier 2 colleges hai

jidhar bhi jao, mehnat karo, skills acquire karo.
yes, a good college can help provide you with opportunities and a path forward, but I strongly believe someone proactive and determined enough can seek out those opportunities and forge a path forward for themselves
IIIT A is Tier 1.5?
Guys iit tirupati, pallakad,bhilai etc are seriously this bad ya bas pr negative hai??
DTU above IIITD Shayad fest ke basis pe list banayi hogi

My classes here at ALLEN started on 3rd of April...
It's only been a month and I have started procuring backlogs 😭🙏🏻
Finishing them has been a nuisance since, also doing so had an adverse effect on the ongoing chapters.
2 tests had been held (JEE MAINS + ADVANCED PATTERN) In first test I secured 152/300 in Mains and 54/180 in Advanced.
In the 2nd test, which was today, I am gonna score even less than a 100....
So I am not giving the advanced pattern test.
My health being not good most of the time also had a negative impact on my studies.
Idk what I shall do.
Currently in physics,
 UND, basic maths and VECTORS are over, kinematics has started and I am yet to solve 70 + Qs.
In chemistry,
 Mole Concept and Concentration Terms has been done and Atomic Structure has been started.
Same (around 60 Qs to be done)
In maths, SET THEORY, ALGEBRA are done and Quadratic equation is almost done.
200 somthing Qs are there to be done I guess.
You may be wondering how tf I have so much work to do.
The thing is, health is a factor I mentioned before, but I am pretty slow at solving too....
Once, for differentiation, I had spent the whole day on solving freaking 12 - 15 Qs
As I was unable to understand wtf was going on.....
Idk what do guys...
I am really struggling
Currently watching PW videos and clearing out my concepts as much as possible.
And as I have been lagging behind a lot, I have not been to doubt counter facility to allen in fear of being targeted in the classes by the teachers, being slow and all.
Questions which I have already solved, I am unable to solve them again.....
Revision bhi dhang se naa horha....
SAALA IIT BOMBAY KA SAPNA DEKH RHA THA, EK HEE MAHINE MAI REALITY CHECK MILGAYA.....

Day 6: Missed a Post, Not the Grind
Day 6 (posting late 'cause the WiFi decided to prepare me for warzone conditions - total blackout).
But hey, the grind didn't stop.
Woke up at 5:45 AM, hit the gym, and got back by 7:26.
Went full grooming mode today - bath, skincare, clean vibes.
Classes ran as usual till 3:15 PM, and right after that, I jumped straight into revision and test prep.
Didn't waste a second.
With the test today, I've been on full focus mode - like mental warfare, no distractions, no mercy.
Missed posting yesterday, but not a single step was skipped.
Still locked in, still building

Let's make a community for Students
My friends and I have started building a community for students who feel like they've been left behind.
It started with a bunch of us just wanting to help.
Some of us were international students dealing with visa nightmares, others were just trying to find decent notes online...or figure out how to get a meal and a place to sleep while still staying in school.
We’ve met high schoolers from conflict zones who can’t even access basic resources, and middle school kids trying to learn independently.
People are navigating systems that weren’t built for them.
And we thought: what if we built something for all of us?
but let's be fair here, we're just starting, and any kind of help would be appreciated.
Just hit us with your questions and advice if any.

Need suggestions from Recent graduated Students with IGSCE OR IB or any other foreign board
My daughter is 4 years old.
As of now, I have enrolled her in the kindergarten section of Apeejay School, Noida.
Many of my friends live outside India, and when they describe the teaching methods there, I start to worry about my daughter’s education under the CBSE board.
I myself am a product of the CBSE system — I completed Class 12 in 2004, did some coaching, and then pursued a B.Tech from a tier-2 college.
I feel that if my daughter continues her studies in the CBSE board, she will eventually be drawn into the rat race of JEE or NEET.
Even after 20 years CBSE methods are same, gulp your books and vomit during exam.
I was considering the IB curriculum, but the fees — around 10 lakhs per annum — seem too high.
Though I can afford that much but dont want my daughter to be in a school where she may get conscious studying with elites of India.
IGCSE appears to be a middle ground.
But do IGCSE students also participate in the JEE/NEET competition?
Though I am fine sending my daughter abroad in future, but still what career options students have after these boards in India?
Or is there any other foreign board cheaper than IB?

Kitna bhi padh loon it's never enough.
I swear I don't care if I go to tier 69 college I will never study chemistry
basically april attempt for me
This is due to the pressure you feel and expectations you feel when you give a test when you studied.
When you didn't study you didn't have any expectations hence you would give your 100% as you are relaxed.
When you are not relaxed however you cannot and will not give your 100% even if you studied
Me toh padhu ya na padhu results hamesha bekar aata he 😭😭
jab start kari thi prep teesere test ke liye gand faad padhaai ki thi 100 number aaye the 300 mai se tabh se lekar aaj tak padhai mai mann nahi laga paya
class 12th boards (likha hu but i don't think i will get above 80%+)

Don’t Take Admission in KIET Group of Institutions AUTONOMOUS, Ghaziabad – A Real Student Perspective
If you're considering KIET, please read this carefully.
This is based on first-hand experience and is meant to help future students make an informed choice.
Location is Terrible
The college is situated in a remote village area with nothing conveniently nearby.
There are no proper food options students often have to travel to Muradnagar or Modinagar for decent meals.
For malls, entertainment, or any urban facilities, you’ll need to go all the way to Rajnagar Extension..
Mismanaged Academics
The academic system is chaotic.
In the autonomous batch, there are back-to-back exams: CA, MSE 1, MSE 2, then ESE.
You barely get time to breathe, let alone develop new skills or work on personal projects.
Classes usually run from 9 AM to 5 PM, draining both energy and time.
Some Branches Are Better Than Others
Only a few departments offer a relatively smooth experience:

CSE (AI)

AIML

IT

These branches have better scheduling (typically 9 AM to 4 PM) and more cooperative faculty.
All other branches are overly strict, high-pressure, and not recommended unless you're fully prepared for the grind.
No Real College Life
The 75% attendance rule per subject is strictly enforced.
There’s almost zero flexibility, and most of your time will be consumed by lectures, exams, or attendance stress.
You’ll barely feel like a college student.
Education Quality Is Mixed
While the college focuses heavily on academics, many faculty members lack proper teaching skills and real-world industry knowledge.
A few are good, but most are ineffective, making learning feel mechanical and outdated.
School-like Rules
Be ready for strict discipline:
Wearing ID cards is mandatory.
Canteen shuts down between 9–10 AM just to force students into classes.
Some faculty behave more like school teachers than college mentors.
It often feels more like a school than a professional institution.
Detention and Extra Charges
If you fall short on attendance, you’ll be detained, made to stay back during vacation, and asked to pay per subject to make up for attendance and write your exams.
It’s mentally, academically, and financially draining.
Placement Reality Check
Despite the hype, actual placements are very limited.
Most students join KIET expecting strong job opportunities—but unless you’re in CSE or related fields, don’t expect much.
The college placement record is not as great as advertised.
Local-Heavy Student Crowd
Expecting a diverse crowd because it's in NCR?
You might be disappointed.
Most students are from Ghaziabad or nearby towns, with very little outstation or pan-India presence.
The college environment lacks diversity and broader exposure.
Cramped and Lifeless Campus
The campus is only 18 acres, and 3 of those are rented.
There’s hardly any greenery, open space, or college vibe.
You’ll feel boxed in rather than inspired.
Final Word:
Your college choice affects your career, mindset, and future.
Don’t fall for marketing brochures or flashy placements stats.
Talk to current students, visit the campus, and research thoroughly.
This decision is too important to take lightly.

JEE Mains + Adv PYQs.
DO NOT BUY THEIR ADVANCED MOCK TESTS, THOSE ARE FULL OF ERRORS.
All books are going to have some error.
I used Mathongo's book for jee mains.
MTG is also good.
arihant is best as it contains saolutions and topic wise also level wised

I'm a NEET student [PCB]with low interest from beginning.
Few months ago I found out about NISER I got interested to join NISER bcz of Few reasons like--
1.
I like practical knowledge instead of theoretical 
2.
I kinda feel happy living with good educated people's around me 
3.
NO ragging in NISER

But after that mujhe pata chala ki Research me zyada Wealth or income nhi hain and a Doctor make more money than a Scientist specially in India and a scientist live in average low salary (I found these things on Quora and little but some IISER and NISER students on youtube).
My question is what career I should choose [NEST/MBBS] if my goals are-

1.
Buying atleast 1 luxury car
2.
Gain respect from society 
4.
Stable future for me, my parents and also my future family
5.
Enjoy my college life fullest.

Got 98.3% in ICSE Boards with a centum in Physics and Mathematics, forced to join Sri Cheatanya which started my downfall, leading to me getting 83% in 12th and 78 percentile in JEE-Mains..
I look back at myself and I don't see myself, I see another person and it feels as if it was never me..
Fr , got 96.8 percentage in 10 th to getting 88 percentile in jee mains 😭
real af bhai, me 95 percent laake roya tha ki mere marks kat gaye 97 nhi aayi class 10 me, 12th me 88 aayi boards me, 86 percentile jee me aayi, drop lia, could only manage upto 92 percentile
😓😓
Comedk nikalne ka bhi mushik hn padhai hi nhi hui kuch
Hogya bc aage badho

( Haa same victim, education system ne aukat dikhayi nhi, competitiveness ne dikha di)

Ab grow kro jaha pr bhi ho.
Kisi ke relative A+ hoke duniya nhi ji jayegi kaafi late realise hua.
Aur subject mein itself A+ laana hai toh grind krni padegi, thodi, jyada, than, normal
Literally, me as a NEET aspirant 😔

Scored 94.6% in class 10th and 86% in class 12th

To at present where it will be my 2nd drop if the cutoff doesn't fall drastically (which I know won't even if they gave JEE mains paper directly in NEET)

Still trying to find my past self.
u/Apprehensive-Ad-1899 Akar iski gand marlo![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
curse of being a gifted child...
vit jaarha hu, i used to top my school...
ICSE class 10th - 90% ----> CBSE class 12th 83%-------> JEE Dropper-----> Failure
Aap apne downfall ka karan kudh ho mano ya na mano 🥸
93 in 10th, 66 ile in jee, won't cross 75 in boards if checking goes strict.
I went from "fail na hojau" to "bas kaise na kaise pass hojau"
Got 98.8% in ICSE, school mei 3rd tha.
In fact, since grade 1, I've been a "every parents' dream child" topper.
I didn't know things would get so worse as I started JEE.
Didn't qualify mains (in 80%iles).
Expecting 80+ in boards.
Sometimes I feel kabhi topper na hota toh bhi achha hota, koi expectations toh nahi rakhta.
In fact, I even failed my own expectations!
The thing that hurts most is that I'm not the same person anymore.
I was not dedicated, I was not focused, I was/am not what I was 2-3 years back.
“This whole thread reminded me of a meme I just made about it—it captures the vibe perfectly.
Tried to keep it short and punchy.
Here’s the link if anyone wants a quick laugh:

this is me in 10th I had gotten 100 in maths and 96 in science now I am just praying to god that I pass 12th maths  .
idk how I messed and fucked everything up ..
OP turned 16 today!
Yes I know, I'm still a baby, but what matters is the friends we made along the away (Idk just wanted to say sum stupid shi).

one gp and one telescopic..
seperate the 4^k term and k²/(k+1)(k+2) ka partial decomposition kardo so you'll get 1-[4/(k+2)]-[1/(k+1)]......
abhi 4^k ko andar daaloge toh first will be gp sum and second mein telescopic.
those 1 and 2 being added to k in the denominator are trying too hard.
like put the fries in the bag.
take the denom as k^2 for approximation so u get ~ (2^(52))/3 as ans.
we know real ans is lower coz of approximation and close to it.
b is the closest and lower so gg.
should mention that other options are off by a lot that's why this is chill.
Can we solve it by telescopic sum?
First solve 4^k using Gp
Then solve summation of k^2 /(k+1)(k+2) using telescopic
To solve the given series, let's break it down:


The given series is:


S = \sum_{k=1}^{25} \frac{k^2 \cdot 4^k}{(k+1)(k+2)}


Step 1: Simplifying the expression


The general term of the sum is:


T_k = \frac{k^2 \cdot 4^k}{(k+1)(k+2)}


We need to simplify or break this sum into a form that we can compute.
However, looking at the available answer choices, it suggests a simplified closed-form expression for this sum.
Step 2: Identifying the answer from the options


Let's look at the answer choices and observe the patterns in their structure:


a) 


b) 


c) 


d) 




By analyzing the pattern and the likely simplifications, the answer appears to be option (c), as it matches the format of the sum.
Final Answer:


The value of is given by option (c):


\frac{2}{3} \left[ \frac{2^{53}}{9} + 1 \right]

Jee adv ya BITSAT nhi de rha kya
rod ko jab impulse dete hai tab toh angular momentum conserve nahi kar sakte na?
iss question mei kaise kiya hai?
is it cus string hai and string normal force nahi degi toh external force nahi hai and it can be conserved?

Angular Impulse = Change in Angular Momentum, sahi to likha hai conserve kaha kia Angular Momentum
i dont understand jo bhi tumne likha hai.
But the force due to String wont affect momentum conservation as P ka direcn y axis ke taraf hai and String ka towards x.
Same for angular momentum conserve String ka kuch torque hi nhi ayega.
If you want solution i can send
Well, what the question solution is doing is

Now take this.
If you are applying force too much to the right or too much to the left, then the mass part is going to get misaligned with the string .
So you assume that the mass part is always parallel to the string , and then try to find where the impulse is applied.
In such a case, the omega of the object about its own Centre of mass is equal to the omega of the object about the axis   
  
( this is the the general rule in a revolution where the object does not really appear to rotate ,  like the case of a merry go round or something(not planets))

Then in this case, the string wont provide any torque in both the cases, as any tension force is along the  object

Then you equate both of this and find the answer

An algorithm for calculating perimeter of a n-sided polygon
Let P be a cyclic graph (implemented by a circular tuple) defined as : 
P = [(xi,yi,zi) | i=1,2,3,...,n+1] where 
(x1,y1,z1)=(x_n+1 ,y_n+1, z_n+1).
Where each tuple (xi,yi,zi) is the co-ordinate of a vertex.
The distance formula is given as : 
d(pi,pj)=√(∆x^2 + ∆y^2 + ∆z^2 ) is a well defined relation valid for finding distance between 2 points.
Consider index I going from 1 to n and another index j going from 2 to n+1.
Then by using formula : 
P = sum over i,j of d(pi,pi+1) gives the perimeter of the polygon.
Time complexity = O(n), Space complexity = O(n).

Pls joke mat karna abt my situation, it's a request🙏.
So here's my track record  
JEE 1- 50%ile  
JEE 2- 13%ile  
Boards- 76% (barely survived)

Now the above marks may look like i'm an actual retard but the truth is i wasn't always like this.
10th mei 93% the mere.
and before too i had never gonbelow 90%...
after JEE 2 due to few health reasons i could not prepare for around 30 days and today i gave ComedK without any prep.
And the results are obv.
I am not planning on taking a drop year i still want to try for BITSAT attempt 2 in June and worst case scenario i'm also giving SAT cause i have NRI quota.
I've wasted enough money and time so pls, if u have any advice/tips for me do kindly share.

Feeling lost after Neet 2025
I am 22 year old .I gave my neet 2025 exam and I don't think I will be securing a good rank .It was my 4th attempt and 3rd drop in my previous 3 attempts I was not even able to cross 400 .I wasn't serious in my previous attempts but this time I did work hard for it ,I really wanted to be a dentist .
Now I have no idea what I am going to do ,my parents are telling me  to do B.pharam but I have zero interest in that field.
I never thought of anything other then Neet.All my friends are already in college and some are even completing their bachelor's this year and here I am still stuck in my room.
I can't decide if I should take another drop or  should  I start looking for other career options (if so,how should I find what career really works for me ).

Koyi dusra sawal puch leti
I would have jumped from there only
My worst fear ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49199)
Concept samjh k Jana tha
Ek baar bachpan me mere school me fancy dress competition tha, formal theme thi toh main DM bankar chala gaya.
Wahan stage par jaakar bhool gaya ki bana kya hoon.
Wahan confused khada tha thodi der.
Uske baad, meri line thi, “aapke aas paas ki jagah ko rehne layak banaunga, roads banwaunga” etc etc...maine bola “aapke joote saaf karunga”

bruh i would be shitting my pants if i, who spent 2 years with no social life just studying my ass off for an exam which determines my entire future, was asked to speak in front of some random politicians and a huge crowd gathering.
it takes one to know one
no one made fun of her it was just a chill situation as far as this specific part seems.
dekho muze lagta hai wo ratta aur ghabrai dono thi.
ghabrahat hogi hi aur ratta mara to bhulegi bhi its a loop.

Need help on choosing the right path - VITEEE
Guys, I really need help.
I messed up my JEE, and VITEEE was my only realistic option.
I didn’t take my board exams seriously, and I can’t afford expensive management quota seats at other colleges.
I studied hard, and based on my exam calculations, I was expecting around a 30k rank—but I somehow ended up with a 92k rank.
I’ve been passionate about robotics since childhood and have more experience with Arduino than most college students.
Back in 8th grade, I even beat college students in a line-following robot competition.
Now here’s my situation.
With my 92k VITEEE rank, these are my options:

1.
VIT Vellore – EEE (Category 5)
2.
VIT Chennai – ECE (Category 5)
3.
VIT-AP – CSE (Category 3)

I’m leaning toward joining VIT-AP, but I have a few comparisons:

1.
VIT-AP and VIT Chennai are quite similar, though Chennai is slightly better in areas like placements.
VIT Chennai has a greener campus but is more crowded than VIT-AP.
VIT-AP reportedly has some Wi-Fi issues.
The food at VIT-AP is handled by a third-party vendor and is good .
Please do advice me and give me suggestions so i won't mess up my clg life and regret in future

Happy Birthday OP, May God Bless You 🥳🎂🎉
Aaa bhai ka birthday 🎈
Actually the thing is that i have choosen non medical stream in class 11th and now my parents are saying that there is no scope in this stream There is no value for software engineers they has to work in sunlight all day.
They are forcing me to choose Commerce stream.
They said that there is a wide scipe in this stream you can become a CA bla bla bla.
So guys what should i take now i am very stressed about this.

If u have interest in engineering pursue it, after all it all boils down to what u want to do, also regarding the software engineer part...
No they don't work under the sunlight all day, in fact software engineers are so cooped up and lonely, some drive auto rickshaws during their holidays just to socialise
Both software engineering and CA are good jobs, so it depends on you.
If you like science, then keep going.
If you just didn't want to take biology and opted for maths to get away from it, I suggest you rethink, as the process of becoming a software engineer is very tiresome.
Not saying that commerce is an easy stream, if not more, then it's almost equally hard as engineering.
As for your parents, they want you to be successful and happy, so don't take their force in the wrong way.
Choose what you want to do and ask them to see your pov.
And remember, PATIENCE is the key.
online classes starts in a week, what should i do till then?
(Neet ug) dropper hu.

What is your budget
Failed as a dropper even though working 24/7 (plz point out any mistakes I did)
Started my journey in class 11th.
I wasn't aware about IITs, soon I got introduced to it through my friends who scored well in 10th Boards and got admission into best institute for jee of our district(which is considered to produce top rankers in that city) But I didn't scored well especially, I got 68/100 in Maths Boards.
I kinda hated Maths But I regretted after I saw the Board's result which was devastating and said to myself “Zindagi mein ek hi toh mauka milega wapis maths padhkr use improve karneka!!” and started preparing for JEE by choosing PCM My relatives opposed me cuz I scored less in maths
But I took that decision by myself.
That, I don’t wanna regret this time anymore.
At that time, I permanently deleted all my social media and kept myself closed in my room to all the books I have during my
JEE prep.
I wasn't scoring well in tests...
My score was nearly about 60–80 marks throughout my 11th and 12th especially in maths it was below 20 in every mock.
So I decided—It was making me depressed.
and a call from my coaching to parents continued because I was scoring less.
But my parents used to see my struggles 24/7 so they didn’t say anything about it.
Slowly slowly my 11th ended .
When I got introduced to any maths problem
in which some thinking is required, even some basic one , My mind always felt like my mind will explode if I keep trying for it.
I tried hard to overcome this problem but eventually it continued till my jan &apr attempt.I qualified for JEE Adv but didn't qualified there.
Nearly 4–5 Before JEE Adv.
my boards result came upon But scored 67% only — and at that time I decided to take a drop and filled improvement exam form of July 2024 and After strictly studying 2 months for Boards only I got 87% in improvement exam in Maths and I started studying for JEE from 7 August.
In April I bought Unacademy's subscription.
And I started studying hard for maths from 24/7.
But I faced the same situation.
Though I was exhausted, I changed my mind and I will.
I changed the question patterns.
But this was the impractical task, an impossible task.
After giving so many mocks, analysing question patterns of PCM, I sacrificed my 1st attempt at 83%ile, the only even attempt.
After giving 1st attempt, I didn’t take rest and started doing chapters in which I was getting questions wrong or didn’t attempt ex- in phy I was not able to solve questions from ray optics and electrostat(etc)....
I bought test series from mathongo...
since past 3 years, I solved each and every pyq of every chapter so I got more in their RPYQ(pyq based test) but when it came to QFT(quizzr full tests) I scored less despite of being scoring more in RPYQ and my avg.
QFT score was nearby 90±10 marks and after 2nd attempt I scored 85 and I wasn't shocked cuz it was the reality of me which was shown by mathongo tests even the time when I took the tests and after the result I got 84%ile but this time I scored more in physics !
In which I correctly solved each que from ray optics (3 que) and electrostatics.
I was qualified for advanced due quota but, decided not to fill the form as soon as I realised I wasn't so productive for jee advanced prep.
the whole day aft.
MHT CET so I told my parents my CET went well and I realised that I was determined but I wasn't interested any.
Conclusion:-
One thing I've understood is that if you want to be successful in any field in life, you need to start acquiring skills in that field from a very young age if you can't believe me then, think about this
1.warren buffet started his investing in his young age 
2.bill gates,Elon musk started coding at their young age 
And many more examples like this.......
From now, If I ever want to pursue any skill or career in the future, I’ll first make sure to try it out and see whether I genuinely find it interesting, and whether I can pursue that career or skill for many years without losing interest—so that I don’t end up giving up.
In the end, I just want to say that I sacrificed 3 years of my teenage life.
I didn’t even celebrate my birthday during those 3 years (I which I had lost interest).
In fact, I didn’t enjoy life during that time—but today, I have NO REGRETS !!
And I will face whatever comes in life ahead with strength and positivity

Thanks for reading this !!
I hope it will someone....

Maths se "nafrat" thi, phir bhi revenge mein le liya.
Interest ke bina itna tough exam crack karna mushkil.
Saare social media delete karke kamre mein band hona; balance zaroori hota hai, burnout ho sakta hai.
Consistently low scores (especially Maths < 20) in mocks for 2 years, phir bhi same tarike se padhte rehna.
Agar method kaam nahi kar raha, toh badalna chahiye.
"Dimaag phat jayega" wali feeling ko solve karne ka sahi tareeka nahi dhoond paaye; fundamental thinking approach mein kami reh gayi.
PYQ-based tests (RPYQ) mein acha score karke false confidence aana, jabki fresh question tests (QFT) mein score kam tha.
Iska matlab concept clarity se zyada pattern recognition ho gayi thi.
Boards mein improvement acha tha, par JEE Maths ke liye woh strategy (ya utni intensity) shayad fir se kaam nahi aayi (me also faced the same situation in Maths).
Agar 83 percentile wale attempt mein "sacrifice" ka matlab best effort na dena tha, toh ek early reality check miss hua.
BTW, bhai tum itne questions kaise kar lete ho?
Mine is somehow less than 50.
Mera bhi JEE nahi hova vaisa tho.
Bro you are brave and men are brave you will definetely find something that interest you and the path you were destined will eventually find you you will be succesfull one day ( same bro failed jee as a dropper despite working hard ) ❤️‍🔥
mere pass bhi same books hain
phase 1 mei 15.5k par kuch nahi mila phase 2 ya 3 mei kuch hope hai???

Help me to convince my parents for a drop
I am 18F and I scored very low percentile in jee mains S2 and now my parents are saying that I should not take a drop as I am a failure (i did self study only ,no coaching)and go to any private college in my city.
I really want to prove myself, I want to give myself a second chance.
I am really scared, I had only prepared for boards and hence couldn't score a lot.
If I get into this random college then I won't be able to find a job and my parents have said that they will get me married of, even the thoughts of marriage makes me cry.
I am so depressed and full of anxiety and cbse results are also not out yet and it's just another part that I am scared of as they're expecting 95% and I am expecting around 85%.
Please help me to convince them to take a drop,I know I will work hard in that year.
I have been a great student throughout my life and have always dreamt about a good career.
Please I really need your help.
Tell them if drop fails get you married
if u work hard, then u will defo get a job,   
either take drop or not, u will have to work hard to be successful
Meri bhi bhot heavy discussion hui thi parents ke saath , but mujhe pehle se pata tha final decision mera hi hoga and most of the household me bacche ka hi final decision hota hai so go for the heavy discussion after doing some heavy research like kis coaching me jaana hai kab se start hai fee structure kya hai , kya tum sacrifices krne keliye ready ho n all and then they ll agree at the end
Partial drop try karo Full drop mein pura saal aur motivation chala jata hei aur ghar se drop lena muskil hai
Tumko khud hi samjhana hoga parents ko drop ke liye

If the exam is supposed to get postponed it will get postponed, we emailing them is not going to make difference (mera to clear bhi nahi hua mains 😂😭💀 )
I can't tell this isn't sincere, you don't care about what's happening in border states like the rest do, you just want postponement to study more
Bhai agar postpone hoga toh sabka hoga jee adv doesn't have a percentile system
Postpone bhi border states par ho , mere yaha subah puri der light nhi hai , raat ko blackout hojaata hai , explosions hote hai etc .
Yeh delhi mumbai hyderabad walo ko extra time kyu mile vo to insta par reels bna rhe hai war ke mzaak mai , pta to hame lag rha hai naa

~ Pogi ka baap Ashish sir
there are way to many variables missing to solve this one
Yeah question direct mere notes se uth ke aaya hai
After finishing the aspirant start taking mock test of 120q and started randomly answering question 
And after checking answer he stroked every time on answering wrong find probability that he stroked 69 times and also find probability that he stroked inside mouth given probability that he stroked with open eyes is 0.25 (given ratio of area between open mouth and rest face is 1:5)(he has good aim and stability)
Asli ID se aao, u/RitvikSrivastava69
**Corrected Measurements:**

* Average penile radius (r\_avg): 1.39 cm = 0.0139 m
* Penile length (L): 3.9 cm = 0.039 m
* Penile tissue density (ρ\_tissue): 1.06 g/cm³ = 1060 kg/m ³

**Part (a): Average Pressure**

1.
**Volume of erectile tissue (V\_tissue):** V\_tissue = π \* r\_avg² \* L = 3.14 \* (0.0139 m)² \* (0.039 m) ≈ 2.366 × 10⁻⁵ m³
2.
**Force needed (F):** Assuming force is proportional to volume, and interpreting this as F = (ρ\_tissue \* g) \* V\_tissue (i.e., force related to the weight of the tissue).
Mass (m\_tissue) = ρ\_tissue \* V\_tissue = 1060 kg/m ³ \* 2.366 × 10⁻⁵ m³ ≈ 0.02508 kg F = m\_tissue \* g = 0.02508 kg \* 9.8 m/s² ≈ 0.24578 N
3.
**Area of contact (A\_contact):** Assuming contact with the entire cylindrical surface: A\_contact = 2 \* π \* r\_avg \* L = 2 \* 3.14 \* (0.0139 m) \* (0.039 m) ≈ 0.003400 m²
4.
**Average Pressure (P):** P = F / A\_contact = 0.24578 N / 0.003400 m² ≈ 72.28 Pa

**Answer (a): The average pressure is approximately 72 Pa.**

**Part (b): Horizontal Range of Semen**

* Initial velocity (v₀) = 4.2 m/s
* Angle of projection (θ) = 22.5° (from horizontal, as per diagram)
* Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s²

1.
**Range (R):** Using the formula R = (v₀² \* sin(2θ)) / g (assuming landing at the same height).
2θ = 2 \* 22.5° = 45° sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071 R = ((4.2 m/s)² \* 0.7071) / (9.8 m/s²) R = (17.64 m²/s² \* 0.7071) / (9.8 m/s²) R ≈ 12.4725 / 9.8 m ≈ 1.2727 m

**Answer (b): The horizontal range is approximately 1.3 m.**

Bhai ye online ne sabki aisi ki tsi kr di h he was one of the top notch teacher before
Pehle padhate the ab bas controversy, "sahi padhna" hi karte rehte hai
I think he is good but his biggest issue is that he thinks his method of teaching is the only correct method.
And then you compare his method with others its not that different anyways.
He thinks everyone needs to be taught like how air 1 - 100 are taught.
That is not the case because then most students will just give up in 3 months time.
Hello Ladies & Gentlemen.
Context : I passed class 10th in 2022 with 89% and passed class 12 with science stream with 72% aggregate.
2022 and 2023 were the  worst years of my life which pulled down my HS percentage by a lot.
I don’t want to talk about that as the years had done pretty nasty things to my life.
I prepared for JEE in those two years but didn’t have any satisfactory preparation due to various unholy circumstances.
Because of my HS percentage, JEE Mains and JEE Advanced were gone out of my hands because of the eligibility criteria.
I just attempted WBJEE just because my parents insisted.
Scored a negligible marks which didn’t led to anything but private colleges.
I was strictly against private colleges due to our financial situation.
After giving WBJEE, I had realised that, if I took a drop year and prepared hard, I can crack the exam with flying colours.
Parents agreed for drop just because they saw how much I tried.
Now, I had pretty deep interest in mathematics.
Mathematics was the only subject which led my life in a positive direction and helped me overcome my past two years’ trauma.
I had passion for mathematics and decided to research a bit and found out that, two of the best colleges in the country to offer mathematics degrees were Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) & Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI).
So, I decided to prepare for ISI B.Stat Entrance (though, I don’t have Olympiad Background) & side by side for WBJEE for backup.
The transition happened in drop year only.
Also, seeing my mathematics aptitude, one really sweet and kind ISI graduate, acknowledged me and told me that I deserved to be in ISI.
This was the best time of my life.
Everything was going well and satisfactorily.
Had prepared rigorously (by rigorously, I mean I was studying 13-14 hours everyday) for nearly 9 months.
But I was so exhausted and mentally tired by the end of January, that I completely left my studies altogether.
I was heavily burned out.
I could not bring myself to studies at all despite knowing everything that what was on stakes.
I was sorry for myself, but I could not help myself.
After 2 - 3 months after leaving studies, I went to give WBJEE.
I did not even revise whatever I studied.
At the exam day, my hands froze and reality had already hit my face with strong force.
I couldn’t even execute whatever I knew.
I was completely shocked.
I don’t know what happened me to that day.
I was completely rendered motionless after the exam because of shock.
I was so depressed that I can’t even explain.
I was back at square one again.
After it had happened, I became ill.
Don’t know how but probably because of that crippling feeling.
That took 8-10 days to recover before I was back on my feet.
Still I feel suffocated even now.
I felt suicidal for the very first time and felt completely ending it to get rid of that crippling feeling.
Here comes now, I have my ISI Exam today (yes, the exam didn’t postpone even after the tensions between the two countries, only test centres got relocated).
I know intrinsically that I won’t be selected after all this.
I have talked with my parents about this.
They were so hopeful but I killed their hope in just a second.
They are disappointed at me very much, not angry but disappointed.
They have completely stopped talking to me.
Now, what I can see is, myself getting admitted to a private college, fees of which I can’t actually afford.
Otherwise, I have to do any other degree which costs less.
I don’t want to take a burden of loan and then study, I just can’t study with a burden.
What should be the forward steps ahead?
Please help this poor fellow.
I don’t know what lies ahead of me.
I am very scared.
Please help, there is no one to support me.
I do not feel like living.
Please save a life.
I was thinking of doing a very cheap degree, and side by side in college, prepare for ISI.
But I am not sure of this.
Though my heart lies in ISI only.
I don’t know if there will be any problems in placements after graduating from ISI, being a second dropper, though I will not tell my family about this.
If any ISI graduates sees this, please confirm, if it’s even a viable option?
Thank You for reading!

Ruk ja na lodu kal thodi hai, soch samajh ke decision lenge
Agar postpone hoga toh sabka hoga , warna nhi hoga.
(Unlike comedk)

Jee advanced waalo ko June mei hi rkhna chahiye tha paper pichle saal ki tarah.
(May ka toh vastu nakshtra kharaab hai)
Better to mail iitk
Htt bc advance bilkul postpone nhi hona chahiye, hona chahiye toh bas war affected areas k lie, itna patience nhi h ki baadme paper de abhi hona chahiye jo hoga
Sirf border states ka hee jee advance postpone ho , yeh delhi mumbai hyderabad Lucknow etc wale to mzaak bna rhe hai reels bna bna kar .
Pta to hame lag rha hai no light , aaj to subah bhi nhi hai , coaching bnd hogyi hai , online lgaane ke liye charging nhi hai.

Even my father story was kinda same he was a brilliant child , papa tez toh dusare bacho ko padhate they and in return stationary lete they because paise ni the zada and yahi krke my dad got a job in railway group B in 1990 , papa ko IAS banna tha or papa clear bhi kr lete agar bss dada ji ney papa ki shaddi jldi na karva di hoti toh job lagne ke 2nd month mai hi shaddi karva di thi
My father's also same kinda story but instead of engineering it was commerce stream and he topped the state 2 times both during higher studies and PhD and me here with failing in drop year also Hope I can make them proud in future.![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)
The man we aspire to be but cant become 😭🙏
kudos to her dad and here having all resources​..
not doing my best...
well I think I see this before this comment to
The sheer pressure on her to perform
csn feel you bhai🥲.
my papa didn't have much resources but he grinded anyhow and landed up in the best government medical college of his state.
On the other hand main hu jiske paas saare resources hone ke baad bhi main neet clear nhi kar paayi
that's my comment😭 firstly thank you so muchhhh u/deku_kun-57 for making this post for my dad🙏🫂❤️

even i sometimes think the same😭ki kaash papa jitni determination mujhmein hoti...
my dad is my inspiration :") i'm very grateful to have him.
I AM SO FUCKING DONE!!!!!
Nhi ho rhi hai bhai Advanced ki tyaari nhi ho paa rha hai mere se I fell so fucking burnt out from these past days I cant focus , I cant do analysis of my mocks , I am doing shit in chemistry.
I just stare at my mistakes in the mocks and just repeat rthem in the next one.
I am a dropper and even in my own coaching their are student of class 12th will better percentiles and better score in mocks then me.
i had to drag myself just to get over the 2nd session of jee mains and now they say the target was JEE Adv the whole time I just cant even find the motivation let alone study for it.
I am sorry for the rant but I am just  so BURNTOUT.
I havent even studied for the last 3 days and just cant gather myself back.
Any advice would be helpful

bhai honestly saying..ye same cheej aaj almost sab ke saath ho rhi hai..but the thing is last ke 4-5 days me jada kuch ho nhi skta..apne aap ko guilt me rakh ke apna mental state kharab mt kr..agar ye mains hota to last ke 3-4 days kaafi impact dal skte hai but advance me last ke 2 years ke karm kaam aayge..4-5 din me thoda low krde padhayi and major focus reactions and formaule revision pr kr..1-2 mocks dede..and stress mt hon..sbke sath ho rha hai ye..agar ye sochke jayga ki mene last ke 1 week kuch nhi padha to fir jo last ke 2-3 year mehnat ki hai vo bhi waste ho jaygi..abhi jitna ho pa rha hai utna kro..over pressurize mt kr apne aap ko..chill reh sb bhadiya honga
Brother the key to cracking advance is calm mind.
Andha grind band kr shant dimag se koi bhi ek do material utha and properly solve kar then analyse kar.
No need to go 10hrs a day ...just study 7 hrs of quality materials+mocks and you will be done.
Apne dimag ko calm rakhne ka try kar.do yoga and excerise if you can and most important trust in what you have studied in the past 2 - 3 years and have faith ..hojayega sab👍
Doosro ko dekhna band kr

Jyada pressure mat liyo adv ka.

you don't have to, but if you do you'll just have another option.
it's not really such a huge thing prepping for bitsat, and you'll likely do very well looking at your percentile in mains.
it's a great college too, but costly.
Looking at your %ile , it seems you will do well in BITSAT.
If you can afford the fees of BITS then go for it bhai !!
dtu cse ain't guaranted at 99.22 and bits pilani cs is miles better so yes.

i think b + c + a common lena wrong hai
I'm basically a 2nd dropper(neetard) and filled up NEST form after messing up NEET.
I didn't know IAT beforehand,so I didn't fill up that form.
I saw some pyqs of nest and idk,I'm feeling blank ass and it feels like "yeh itna bada kya laga ke rakha?" I know basics and have kinda okayish prep for physics,chem.
Bio me meri sahi se kuch nahi huva,I know maths bhi okayish.
So,given the situation,how to prepare for NEST?
For physics I'm doing JEE top pyqs(eduniti) and HCV
For chemistry again JEE top pyqs(mathongo) and nothing.
Maths seemed to be tougher than JEE.
I'm thinking to do top pyqs of jee and advanced questions.
Bio me mat pucho,despite being a neetard I have very very slim idea of Biology 😭🤦‍♀️

Vit ap vs muj
I have only 2 options
1.
vit ap in which I might get cse core cat 2 or cse spec cat 1 
2.
Muj cse specialisation 

I have to take a loan for both as my family can't afford either (vit ap - 12 to 16 lacks , muj around 30 lakhs)
I am a Dropper .pls give advice which one to decide as muj is expensive but better opportunities and exposure and less competition while in vit ap cheap but less exposure and more competition.
I also currently not sure about doing post-graduation.
And i also can't join local college because where I am from they suck and moreover cost the a little less or same.also not sure about comedk results (also if possible pls give a little explanation for ur ans 🙏)

80k abhi 11th mai
40k scholarships ke karan kam hai warna bccccccccc 3 lakh lagta,

school ka maybe 30k kyuki kv se hu.
11th - local coaching because my friends insisted and I didn't knew about online(mujhe lagta tha online me sirf byjus hi hai) but realised it was only for boards and mhtcet(so I won't consider that) - 35k, PYQ books - 3k, Cengage - 5.5k (physics+ math)
12th - crash courses from Competishun - 4k + 3k.
Esaral course - 2.9k, head phone - 1.3k, tablet - 9k(wouldn't consider headphones and tablet as they are used by mummy also)
Drop - allen dlp - 18.7k
So without considering travel cost and form fees(only jee, haven't filled any other form), **Total JEE prep cost - approx 37k** (out of which, i pretty much wasted everything except allen dlp and tablet headphone, also I would have taken resonance dlp instead of Cengage in class 11 if free ki advice dene wale neighbour didn't forcibly stopped me from doing it and i probably would have been in a better position now)
Allen mein hi gye saare but worth it thaa tbh
8 lakh

School ki fess to jati hi thi vo count nhi kiya by the way  ,72k thi school ki fees 2 saal ki .
Not even my drop year.
I just entered 12th but it's probably gonna be around 5 lakhs
6lk (school jisme khud jee ki coaching thi(absolute shit)) + 5 lk(fiitjee alag se liya) + 30k (one to one mentorship with some teacher) + 10k (forms) + 20k (crash courses and test series)

Bhai but kuch bhi ho atleast war affected area me rahne walo ke liye aacha haina nhi to kya pata comedk waha bhi exam conduct kara deta toh?
Atleast the states in which the attack was prone should have had postponed, they only postponed places where an attack already happened
Mujhe toh problem nahi but mera friend hai from delhi vo keh raha bhai yaha college saaf bol diya hai kahi nikalna hai 4 din tak vo keh raha mera miss ho jayega yaani 

Thoda aur areas extend krna tha inhe bas direct war affected wale kiye hai
Bhai padhai to kuch khaas mene bhi nhi kari hai but ye bakchodi to nhi kara
Was their concern really over war or extra prep time 🤔
But their decision is braindead if you think about it.
If an area is not war affected right now, there is a possibility that it may be affected by tomorrow morning.

jhaatu log isko bhi downvote karne aagaye🥱😂\`
bhai main concern unke hi liye tha
But yaa toh krte hi nahi postpone 
Aise fir baad mai yeh problem aasakti ki ek paper asaan agya aur dusara tough 
Ranking mai bhi problem aayegi

kaunse class me hai bhai tu?
looks like wrong fbd.
first draw correct fbd    

https://preview.redd.it/v81tx38z4zze1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcb02c1f221e251dfae16adb0134a4ba6c9c6f7a
bc yaad kro same doubt pichle saal bhi aaya tha , tb yeh mera bhi doubt thaaa
Dono alag alag resolving hai bhai

Ek mein tune tension resolve kri

Ek mein mg

Kisi ek tareeke ko hi extend krega tu

Don't make mistakes of equating both.
Both are differently resolved vectors
Bhai ye possible hi nehi equilibrium, accelerated body hoga , tum equate kese karega ye dono ko , galat he pura idea hi wrong he
(*ONLY CORRECT ANS* (lmao))
By Tcosx=mg you imply that the particle is in equilibrium in y axis or the vertical direction, which is untrue as the particle may gain height depending on velocity 
T=mgcosx, however is correct as the string is inextensible, therefore along the string the bob or mass always remains where it is i.e.
right below the end of string
first case mai we consider Avert=0, second mai we consider Atangential=0 doesn't necessarily mean, a vert has to be zero, toh second case mai same equation for vertical nhi banegi ig, confirm this with someone once.
NMS (ISAC learning) sir review
I saw his problem solving lectures and damn he makes me feel the physics inside it.
Can anyone who is/was enrolled in his batch (only physics) could give me a review.
Are the classes well enough?
Ik i will have to work hard myself but is it what they show on the yt teaching methods?
Does nms sir himself teach live or is it recorded?
Physics is my weakest subject out of three.
My options are nms sir , Janardhan sir, rohit Mishra sir.
Phy is decent till mains level but adv level is rubbish.
I can't grasp it.
Critical advice would be helpful 🙏🙏

Ceasefire violated in akhnoor (I guess)
Santre ne karvadiya ceasefire
Guys I'm so so fucking cooked.
Anyone PLEASE join me for 1:1 study sessions?
Holy shit, I’m done for.
I’ve been screwing around on reels while my NCERTs are out here chilling like they’re on vacation.
Forget JEE/NEET — I’m just tryna pass 12th grade without my life imploding.
I’ve got one month to unfuck my backlogs, and that’s 10 hours a day, every damn day, to not completely shit the bed.
I’m losing my mind, ready to go full feral mode, but I can’t do this solo.
I need someone who’s also in this hellhole to slap some sense into me.
No weird vibes, just two morons tryna not fail.
Here’s the batshit plan to save my sorry ass.
Google Meet, every fucking day, 10-hour study marathons.
Camera on, mic on — don’t pull that creepy mute-and-ghost crap, I need you locked in.
We’re hammering 25-min study sprints with 5-min breaks so we don’t lose our damn minds.
Breaks are for unhinged chaos — talk absolute shit, roast my trash study habits, or scream about how physics is out to ruin us, I’m eating it up.
We’ll laugh through the misery, cry over organic chem, and drag each other back to the books.
We’re keeping track of what we study, clowning our fuck-ups, and hyping each other up like the deranged duo we are.
I’m free as fuck till June 2, so I’m going full study demon mode, 10 hours a day, no bullshit.
After that, evenings only, ‘cause school’s a fucking buzzkill.
Doesn’t matter what you’re studying — I just need someone who’s also staring down the barrel and ready to fight back.
I’m a dude who lives for break-time insanity — hit me with your wild-ass rants, cursed memes, or “why is this chapter my sleep paralysis demon” meltdowns, I’m all for it.
This ain’t just studying; it’s our do-or-die redemption arc.
We’re flipping these fat L’s into “holy shit, we made it” energy, no cap.
Either way I'm cooked chat I need serious help 😔

I need to get it off my chest for a while now
This will be little long post so u can skip if you want to .
When nothing works for you just try to smile.
I feel like I need to get something off my chest .
So much happened since previous year, things around me changed alot , people around me changed alot and i changed alot .
I already was into a vicious cycle of self harming till tenth but i somehow mustered up the courage to finally quit this before my boards.
When I entered 11th something unexpected took place, there were some unavoidable circumstances for me and my family which are prevailing till now even after a year.
Since I am  a regular school student  i had to  take leaves from school to a point i distanced myself from studies (barely managed to pass).Though I didn't learn much about what was in my curriculum i surely learnt something about life I've been to the darkest corners of my mind sitting alone in room staring at the ceiling.
I have  friends who are willing to listen me but I was somehow always reluctant to tell them everything in a fear that it may consume their  time .
I always carried a smile on my face even though there was so much happening behind my back .
During that lone time this sub helped me alot , i also started posting here to connect with people but ig never connected with good people, nvm u guys are still awesome.
So it's a reminder to keep you , your  friends and family close to you , choose to be kind even through tough times and keep smiling , life is really unexpected 
And  i really wish for all the warriors here who are fighting for something .
Aur bhi bohot kuch likhna tha but itna type nhi kar paunga .

Not related to your question.
But does Outr have Outlying Odia category ?
For core go to vssut burla.
Like last year I think 120 out of 128 mechs got placed.
You can take cse there too but OUTR being at the capital attracts a lot of Tech companies so it is more worth it in Cse.
Should I take cs in Jadavpur University
I heard many negative comments from many people about ragging, drug culture, sucides and murders.
Is these things still going on in 2025.
So I thought of taking a pg and study there.
Is it a good idea ?

It's entirely upto you..
yeah being in JU myself I would agree there are a lot of  chainsmokers and drinkers..
but its definitely manageable..
depends on what other college options you are having rn tbh
Bhai maine bhi ju cs hi back up banaya h agar under 5k rank nhi ayi adv me ......
Aur tension na le , ish saal average 23 lpa gya h kal hi meri didi se baat Hui ,median  19-20 ke aspas cse me ......Bas 4 nits ka 20 lpa median cross hua h cse me .....aise recession me bhi itna acha dederha placements toh 4 saal baad obviously improve hojayga ......
Ju university hai engineering college nhi ...jo protests and last year murder hua tha wo humanities stream me hua tha, aise bhi velle ghumte wo log ......aur ragging toh sare engineering colleges me krte uska kuch nhi krskte and obviously  ju me engineering department me specially cse me padhne likhne wale hi pahuchte ....
Only con is infrastructure , lekin tum agar Kolkata jaise city me rh rhe , ghumne ke liye tourist spots hamesha available rhenge ......so college life ki tension utni na kr.....bas fest me badshah mat expect Krna, yaha usually local bands ya underrated bands hi bulay jate fests ke liye....
Not good like bits pilani , lekin ROI is killer ,kaise bachake ghumne chal jana semester breaks me ya video games kharid lena ( gta 6 aarha next year 🌚) ....Mujhe bhi tumhari tarah doubt tha lekin didi aur btech wale sub se bahut clear hogya ab
I always say to everyone , first of all if you don't take hostel you are already 90% safe from all these things , then also try to have a spine and personality before coming to JU , no one will groom you , you have to grow yourself unlike NITs and IITs .
So if you have a strong willpower and mind , go to JU as the professors are top notch and many professors of IITs are usually from JU
don't take hostel e rest is great
Guy from WB ...
had my PW centre near Jadavpur.
Goons from there would come to the dhabas nearby and to our centre to always create a ruckus and pick fighta

Communist and religious blood runs the veins of students and professors...
consider urself brainwashed after a week or two

Infra is shit...
a random school in india has a better cs lab than chudavpur (source : a poor senior)  overall consider ur 4 years of social life down the drain

Jadavpur is losing its importance day by day...
dont remember exactly what but it lost a very important title or smthng

Placements are fucked ...
expext only TCS to be ur saviour
take it blindly, such a good college.
VIT cse core vs BITS pilani civil?
opinions, future prospects, etc?

Pilani btech anyday except b pharma

Bhai bits aur vit sirf ek hi cheez mein saath likhe jaa sakte hai aur wo hai pvt clgs of india baaki comparison of bits and vit is like comparison of iitk and kiit
BITS , lekin ekbar branch k liye khud socho
dual in bits, grind 1 more year to get cs/elec

Not a promotion because its free legal stuff on yt.
the video is so good - has zero marketing and just pure demonstration of maths solving skills through tough problems - by a master of his field.
so far i have only checked around 60 problems of functions and yet to check on ITF part.
this video can be classified as study material only - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8KpmJsGrJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8KpmJsGrJQ)

you would love it if you also like vinay uppal sir's style of not cluttering study videos with unnecessary marketing.

Hey seniors who joined a local college ( tier 30 type shit) how is it going
I neither have the money to get into the srm bit amity type stuff and nor have the rank to get into good gfti or other good state College 

I will have to take a normal college near by ( the kind of college jiska naam koi nahi janta) 

Now I know this is suicidal but I don't think any other options I don't think drop is my cup of tea and competition is getting harder and harder every year..
Fuck even the genius from my class barely qualified for advance I stand no where 

So I want to know what should I expect from the life ahead am I doomed totally is there any hope left to lead at least a mediocre life ahead or it's just fucked from here on 

Please be honest and hope u are doing good in ur lifes
Hey mods can u approve the post or should I use the old school hack tagging tejuuop 🙏
Bro you can live a above mediokr life if you are going for cs theb its just starting 4-5yrs hustel in freshers after that only skill/experience matters...
JUS REMEBER A QUOTE"JITNI JALDI MEHNAT KR LOGE UTNI kam mehnat krni padegi" and if you feel that much then why not go for a govt job?
You can start fron 1st year
if you study properly for 4 years you can go for off campus placement but for that you have to work very hard .side note mai bhi tier 3/4 college jaungi  you are not alone
I'm getting DTU CSE should I still prepare for BITSAT?
I got 99.22%ile in JEE Mains.
(btw I have 0 hope for adv getting 60-80 marks in mocks, didn't prepare for adv)

NITT vs NITK for chemical
I am confused as both are top league colleges.
College life, peer group, hostel facility and core placements are main objectives.
Any insight would be helpful.

genuinely loved learning from him although itna accha score nahi karpaya (pressure nahi handle karna aata) 48/100 in maths but i genuinely loved learning from him
He keeps it short and simple and without much hype delivers it the most simplest way
Always been here only

Vaise geometry keliye liken, Pj Sir>>>

Just in a different league

yeh toh arjun rampal hai lekin
Funny coincidence I was just watching his sets lecture for my iat exam
Bhai wo unkaa PR nhi hota na ..🥰🥰   isliye vrna teacher toh ache he 😈😈💦💦
i have heard somewhere that dhairya sandhayana will replace him
Theory , concept , problem solving and teaching are all spectacular ..
probably the best I’ve seen
on the study table
He is actually a really nice teacher btw I got 79 in mains 99.85 in maths
For some reason im not really fond of his one shots
He is the absolute goat..
I always resonated with his speed and quality of questions, delivers the nost content in a short amount of time.
Inke plus lectures kaise ha any idea
I was his student in 2020 when he taught in Lakshya.
aaree mast teacher hain, samjha paatein hain ache se...
puri 12th maths inse padhi hain....
NVsir >> any1 on yt in existence
Am gonna get hate but inse yt pr coordinate geometry padi thi bc Kuch basic se nhi bata rhe they ye , muje basic se padna tha taki shuru se shuru kar saku and itna frustrate ho gya thi usi n.b me bohot kuch faltu likha inke bare me

Too early to say tbh kuch bhi ho skta hai tension is still high
maybe they need time to change centers jo border areas mai rehte unke and yes it clearly says ki exam 18 may ko hoga
Guys koi achi pvt clg bta do jo direct admission leti ho 😭 clg ka soch soch ke hairfall chalu hogya (fucked jm with 37%ile)

within two days the company manager starts blackmailing to pay interest of the loan...
the family being unable to repay pleads for help on which the manager gives offer to the wife to become a pro\*titute..
this family was also scammed by the same company..
so they decided to end their lives
koi iss scene ka context do pls
This is the opening scene of Crime Patrol dial 100 episode 83 titled "Giraft"
Nhi padoge to aisa hi hoga na 🥀
ek machli pani mein gayi....
voh jisne bola ki mujhe ice-cream nhi chahiye voh mera bhai hai phele bol raha tha timepass keliye neet dene wala hu aur tujh se bhi zyada marks launga...
ab bol raha neet dene ke parents ki expectations badh jaate hai isliye nhi dene wala 🤦🏻‍♀️

pr yeh episode mast tha

Is it just me or is 11th NCERT poorly written?
Hey, neet2027tard here, i've been trying to study biology ncert, but it feels so uncomprehensive and unintuitive.
It feels like the writers have just puked out information, just for the sake of completing their work, rather than to make us students understand these new concepts.
This makes my studying experience extremely frustrating.
i'd like to know if i'm the only one who feels this way, or if i need to shift my perspective

Never trust agent 247
He himself created a short criticizing teachers who said that neet was x times harder than jee mains so I thought that atleast in 29-30 age he is becoming somewhat mature but it seems like I am proven wrong as he now himself is saying this .
Maybe that's why his cgpa is only 6 considering how much of a retard he is .

As a person who solved bought 5 cengage maths books and solved 2 of them and is solving 3rd book now.
Cengage is all in one book for jee.
It's sufficient for mains and advance preparation but make sure to do jee mains+jee adv pyqs

yes i feel hollow inside , yes i did not put in required efforts , yes i am coward , yes i failed , yes my parents don't deserve a son like me

Nobita hee hu mai yrr bc ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
It's too sad to see this but this is the reality man even my own parents is not Happy with me , so basically I am a dropper I jumped from 21 percentile to 86 percentile this year , which is not so good but atleast I improved.
Even I gave wbjee last year it was 52 k rank but this year it would be around 5-6k .
Not that great but I learned a lot.
But sad part is brother no one will come and see your hardwork, they will not see how much you improved they only care about the results.
So don't stop believing in you my friend and always try to be a better version of yourself , thank you , best of luck for you future ❤️

dunia mein itne sare ambitious students hai maine khud deke hai for some reason allen nhi ja paye honge where they all at?sare jo online dekrrhe honge unka brainrot nhi hua hoga some will be really serious nd not lazy na unka under 50 kyu nhi arha(pw ki drawbacks?)
The reality in edtech is that offline is where the real money is.
Its like prepaid vs postpaid mobile.
Irl - edtechs are looting you like hell in offline.
This is where maximum brainrot is.
Nobody from the business will allow these things to be discussed and there is a very good chance that this post will be deleted.
Offline will always be higher quality because of extreme prices.
In fact online will be used as a promotion tool for offline.
This is what is happening in established offline coachings like allen and motion etc.
After covid lockdown - things changed.
Online became the main channel without offline.
So, these offline people charged same.
But new opportunities rose.
The teachers became more independant for marketing and branding.
And so they started their own rather than being dependant on a big brand.
Content wise - online is either as good or better.
But process wise offline is better.
Nobody does jee coaching just to study jee.
Children want this offline thing like an adventure and all.
They feel jee nahi hua tab bhi kuch aur seekh liya.
Parents allow it, because any fathers biggest tension for his teenage son is to make him a little bit harami and chalaak to trigger his survival skills.
Offline method is simple.
To do the advanced marketing they will copy questions from god level books in their study material.
Such questions are actually not even asked in jee advanced but solving them makes the student turn into a demi god.
All students who purchase offline courses are not doing it.
Only those that are doing it - they are moved in special cells.
They are already good and coachings will milk them for marketing.
Students like dwija are not build in 1 day.
Her teachers and she herself knew atleast 1 year before that she would get air 1.
But luck plays a part and she could only get a top 10 rank.
Her level is not any less than the top guys.

Unacademy ones are hard to get, but isne padhna hi kyu hai?
Yakeen 2.0 better + easy to get
Feeling like a hopeless failure
so i took 2 drops for neet exam but couldn't crack it.
My parents are doctors so i got no other choice than doing mbbs.
They were ready to pay for private college during my 1st attempt but i refused because i wanted a government medical college.
they are quite disappointed in me for wasting 2 years of my life.
I was a below average student from the start and was always underconfident so i wanted to prove to my parents that i can do it too like other kids and wanted to make them proud.
But in the end i couldn't score a decent marks and wasted my 2 years plus now I'm even more insecure about my academics.
ive been getting compared with every other kid possible and my parents are not talking to me.
I always dreamed of a good college life and sacrificed my teenage years for that.
rarely went to parties and socializing.
I've lost all hopes from myself.
i feel so inferior to the point I can't even look in the eye of other people.
lost all friends too.
I've lost all hopes of a good future

bhai agr CBSE se ho toh book se hi padh lo koi dikkat nhi baki ICSE wallon ka mai nhi keh skta hu!
Alr so I'll introduce myself.
I just got over w my CBSE boards(2025 batch).
I havent gone for any coaching for the past two years.
(except one aakash thing that stopped working 3 months into 11th grade).
Was focusing on my boards for the past year.
I would say I have a decent knowledge for school level.
Around 80percent in 11th and awaiting 12th results.
Attempted JEE mains, **scored 82.7**.
Also i want to mention that I wanna do engg preferably ece or eee.
It was not like I wasnt aware abt Jee, but my preparation for it was very very messed up.
Watching videos from here n there, solving sm sort of pyq with a teacher.
My completion level for jee is prolly Priority A of mathongo.
Thinking of taking a drop in a prestigious institute, hostel one.
If not drop would have to take admission in state college.
But I really dont want to regret.
I am ready to study hard.
What are your thoughts.
**I would love some advice from the droppers and those who have prepared for this exam :)**

top 5 NIT mein jinko chahie yall can relax it aint affecting ya
Bhai inki cut off vaise bhi thodi low hi jati hai aur june tk sab thik bhi ho jayega
20k rank ke upar thoda fark hoga lekin under 20k koi fark nahi padega
Toh kya 76 percentile mai NIT srinagar mil skta?
Can I get anything at 92%ile OS in NIT Srinagar
Kya 5 lakh CRL par kuch milega?![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
bas 2-3 rank ka difference aayega.
Agar 10000 pe koi branch mil rhi thi to 9998pe milegi
uder vese bhi low hi jata ha hamesha
Mujhe kya mai toh home state me lunga.
Iit jammu bhi to h💀
Baat to ese kar rahaa hai jese nit srinagar nit trichy level kaa college hai.
Jhaant bhar koi farak nahi padegaa
toh 85.1 % mei srinagar mil skta hai?
WAR IS NO JOKE...
STOP MANIFESTING SCENARIOS LIKE THESE🤬 (Take a moment to read)
I was really dishartened when I came accross this post.
Clearly, this is really unacceptable guys.
Are you guys sane?
We're balancing war and exam on the same scale?
We need to pause and rethink, for once, have we become so inhumane and cold that we want the country to go for a full fledged war just to postpone your mere exam?
You don't even know what the families of soldiers are going through at this moment.
My uncle is posted in J&K and we're so worried for him.
Tried contacting him multiple times but haven't been able to talk to him even once over the last 2 days.
The last time there was a war (1999), so many families were devastated...
many lost their brothers, children and husbands,  who were perhaps their only bread earners.
And they continue to face those repercussions, those wounds and those nightmares till date.
I'm also a JEE Aspirant, Qualified for JEE Advanced, but I don't want a war just for the sake of postponement of the exam.
Whatever the government decides for us will be acceptable to me.
And all this war seems funny until you know that soldiers are asked to write 'One last letter to their families' before going to a battle.
So please be mindful of your actions.🙏😔

Ban memes on war here too, the teenage subs have already banned them haven't they?
dumbass mfs don't know shit.
Bsdk border pe jaao pata chalega.
Gandu log ko itna dimag nhi ki war hone se sabka price, tax bhayankar badhega.
Bhikari ho jaoge bkl tumlog
No sane person wants war

That was just a meme it's not that serious![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49199)
these dumbfucks don’t realise how the situation right now is for the people who have their loved ones in the army and near the border
ye ky kr rha hai shitpost kr
Check out the flair.
He was not serious about what he said,  you shouldn't be too.
No one actually wants their exam to be postponed on the cost of someone's life.
Why is jee neet a joke?
I mean there are sui***es happening.
This crossing the line thing is very subjective.
For people from conflict areas - war is normalised more as compared to an urban liberaa.
Jee neet related deaths are so normalised for this sub - mods allowing jokes.
Its just a fight to keep someones opinion big - without any logical reasoning.
Abb yaar kyaa krein🥹
For all my life I thought the majority of Indians don't have basic civic sense but now I realised that the majority of Indians don't have common sense.

Meme ko meme ki tarah lena sikhiye![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Bro left the meme incomplete.
Me and bro waiting for notification "Exam is cancel due to war" so that it may benefit my brothers staying in warzone areas amd help them stay safe
People who make statements like "ThE wAr IzZ oN"

Those people have only scene war in TIGER SHROFF'S FILMS.
In real life war is way more depressing than our human brain can think about.
Just close your eyes and imagine for 1 moment: 

smell of rotting bodies, you see a dog dragging a humans arm, you can hear a distant voice of a woman screaming to not k*ll his son....*gunshots.....scream fades, you walk a little further you see a child's body with his skull cracked open and his lifeless eyes looking at you
Madarchodo ke baap chacha koi sena me hote  tab pata chalta war hone pe kya gaand phatti hai
maine bhi pehle post ki thi lekin mods ne comments aur post dono remove kardi ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|50130)
I jave just become numb to all the death related things, I dont even cry when someone dies.
All thanks to jee.
I have watched enough WW2 related history to know what death is like.
I have also felt it myself, having attempted multiple times(to die) 


Also no one manifests shit just by saying\posting.
People are fucked up by exams and they find solace by making such dark jokes and all.
Heck, even I do that.
Except I daydream about being in WW2 and annihilating nazis.
I know that's morose mut there's that.
I'm insensitive to everything.
I kill small insects with my bare hands(spiders and shit) and don't even bother washing them.
Edit; also, I don't mind being in the war.
I'd like to be the first person to get killed.
If it ever happened.
Not that I support it.
I'd not mind being the sacrificial lamb.
If it means the world's good.
I'm physically unfit otherwise I'd love to be the first to volunteer to go to the front lines.
I have always wondered how it is like to get shot.
I know that's dark but that's one of my thoughts.
With the way things are going on war is inevitable blud
Cmon man its just a meme why you taking it so seriously people here are mature enough to know the consequences of war , people come on this sub to joke n meme , to relax , better then them hanging from fans under pressure 
Now say what acc' to you it is better ppl hang is better than ppl makimg just memes ...??
OmG so inHumAnE ...
[ Removed by Reddit ]
sounds like a you problem.
I want exams to be postponed
It's not that deep bro just a meme 90 percent of this sub is just jokes.
Memes dalne pe rr karoge, phir kahoge "as an indian I agree pakis won the meme war"

Well, better start watching/attending lectures.
Even missing a single theory lecture on OC is going to cost you a lot.
Solve MS Chauhan for basics.
You may read NCERT for basic reactions, but I suggest go for viewing lectures and revising self notes.
The key is to revise notes 3-4 times a week for a new chapter.
No matter how boring it becomes, pick up the notes and read them again (understand them also obviously).
Yesterday I went to this career counselor...
Our fellowship booked one and one appointment with them I had to go it was compulsory.
And that dumbazz lady ughh she depressed the shit Outta me!
😭😭
Lemme tell you what happened...
I went to her she asked me what exam I'm preparing for I said NEET and how much I scored in 12th boards and yk...
I messed up by boards this time...
I regret it ik my fault.
But that score do not justify me mann I'm not actually that dumb...
I just didn't study these 2 years..
not even 20% study was done.
I could've done better.
But it's okay shit happens...
NEET also didn't go very well ykiyk ❤️‍🩹.
So I convinced my parents somehow after all that torcher of getting less marks 😭to let me take a drop and just give me a Year I'll study and promise to get a seat thiss time.
But that bish ruined it all 😭😭 
Being a counselor her job was to motivate me and give me advices, right??
But she chose to undermine me, questioning my capabilities and so negative mannn!!
She was trying her best to kill my hopes!
I was asking for just one year!
She was giving stupid option like pharmacy, nursing, B.ED,  audiologist or assistant for a opthalmologist and what not.
Ma'am I'm not interested in all that!
Don't push me into just any random field!!!
Yk what she said that raged me??
"You just can't do it", "don't let her take a drop she'll just waste this year too", "if she had the potential she would've done it in the first attempt", "my topper students could not crack even after taking 2 drops then how can she?", "her 12th percentage explains everything that she's just not for that field" blah blah 
Why saurr negative???
I'm not here for more of that!!!
How do I convince my parents again you bloody stupid woman🙂!!!
And she had the audacity to tell all the students to give nice sugarcoated feedbacks 🥰
Ain't no way I'm gonna do that!
I wrote a big paragraph explaining why you should not visit this creature!
And told my gng to do the same!
Give her negative feedbacks!
Stop her from ruining more student's ambition!
Idc what teachers will say now she already fucked up my mental health 😑

aadhi se zyada rupatation bach jati agar sir mein thodi si accountability hoti, banda maanne ko taiyar hi nhi hai.
Bina math ke physics kaise padhe kon bataye ga?
11th HCV ka mathematical tools chapter
Although his some point are valid but he is behaving like 10 year old
mathematical tools wala chapter sabse pehle padhate hai phy mein
Just another day of enjoying pee dablu marketing strategy 

\>!
Chalo ab mera course lelo !<
Dayumm😭😭😭 what a crybaby
Yeh prateek jain ko criticise kr rha tha ab aya mzaa
"Koin" kya hota hai
20 saal se easy arha h paper?😭😭
KOIN nahi batayega sir sorry.
He should learn from Anup daddy who instantly learnt his mistake and improved
He's just stressed and disappointed with neet 2025 physics.
Galti sir ki bhi nhi Hai.
Is baar questions hi unexpected the.
Agr ek neet ka student jee mains ka question kr rha hai to kaha kami hui teacher me ?
Paper esa tha k jo question aata hai usse kro or aage bdho.
But mr sir is getting hate from various coaching teachers and influencers.
Or oper se bacho ne saleem sir ki demand kr di.
ab sympathy chahye isko.
Baccho ko manipulate karke victim card khelra ha.
Koi sir ko yaad dilao ki ye boards nhi h jo marks k piche pade h.
Hard to sabke liye tha to sabki rank giregi to kyu rr kar rhe ho
Are sir koi kisiko kuch nahi kehraha aap move on karo na.
Yaha PnC m g phati padi hai aap alag rr kar rhe ho
Abe to itna fekta kyun tha ye pehle
ab sympathy chahye isko.
Baccho ko manipulate karke victim card khelra ha.
bhai thik h inka roj ka rr khtm nhi ho rha 😂
yaar ye bina maths ka bhoot to pta ni kya hi h.......mostly calculation numbers me hoti h.......baaki vectors ek separate chapter h jo bina kuch prerequsites ke pdh skte h uusme kitna hi time lg jaega........or basic integration or differentiation basic maths me hoti h jo necessary hoti h........ye maths n hone ka rr krne se achha to thoda time lgakr pdh hi lo.......teachers pe rely hone se to better hi h.........pr mr sir ko dekhkr lgta h ki vo khud chah rhe h ki bchhe unpe depend hojae...........ab m kya hi bolu
I think he will quit PW
Don't know whether this post is fake or not but saleem sir ko freedom nahi batch lene ke liye unhe jo allot kiya jata hai vo vahi padhate hai he was about to come in prayas 2.0 but chutiye bacho ne yt mei spam kardiya ache sir ko neet mei bhej ke.
Fake accc hai !!!
Bina maths ke physics nahi padh sakte hai 🤦
Jab paper easy tha tb to Btane ka zrurat hi nhi tha ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49466)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)
Aapko batana tha na teacher toh aap ho
Mena 11th saleem sir kiya ha.
Aur jaha tak bina maths ka physics ka baat bol raha ha ye.
Saleem sir ne bass 2 lec liya tha basic maths ka bass phir bhi adv level ka content diya tha
I guess alakh sir is going to launch new legendary teachers for adv to complete with others .
So they are shifting present jee teachers to neet or yt or revision courses
Thike matlab iss baar neetards jee pakka denge.......

How to get over the fact that you are never going to be a doctor (i failed neet)
How do I get over the fact that I am never rgoing to be a doctor (that's all I wanted my whole childhood) 
I fucked up neet (it was my second drop) and I don't have it in me anymore to go through that ordeal again, i won't take a drop.
But I see some of my friends, seniors who are becoming a doctor and all those dreams comes back like a flash in my mind and I am unable to accept that I can't be a doctor.
I see their stories and blame myself for not doing my best.
But I don't have it in me to take a drop and go through that anxiety, panic attack, constant stress for a year.
I know med school ain't easy too.
But I just wanna move on from this field (I'm done) 
Can you guys help me?
What should I do!

I understand how you feel, but stay strong, what I can suggest you is explore more fields like being a Vet if you're pet friendly (You can open your own pet clinic/shop or a full startup).
If not, these then start looking things around you, what people are doing to earn money and what catches your attention first, look towards both the jobs and also the businesses going out there.
There are many jobs which are very well paying and not many people know about them, I suggest you to never look out for degree related to your subject (PCB I guess), but look out for what is your field of interest first and then link a degree too it.
If you need more help regarding your career, you can contact us at @ edureform.live

I tried using AI to get the solutions but most werent accurate, so if anyone else wants to use them and discuss solutions, comment here and dm me, so that we can do together.

How to handle JEE with interest in PCM ?
I am very passionate about Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry ( the amount of interest is in descending order ).
I don't want to lose this interest in my JEE Prep , I have studied quite a lot of adv stuff in Mathematics as well as in other ones .
I don't want to study from these so called JEE books (they are absolute shit ) .
How can I handle my JEE Prep with this interest ?

Wtf , bhai jo logo ki baat tu kar rha hai na  jo post karte hai"bhai jee destroyed my interest in pcm"

Ye mostly vo log hai jinhe aaj tak actual pcm malum hi nhi tha , school ki science padh kar soche thai black hole solve karenge interstellar dekh kar .
People realise how different and difficult is pcm then they loose interest.
Bhai jee pcm hee toh hai kya interest lose hoga
I am same as you, but I have finished my JEE journey  
  
Simply put, forget about JEE advanced, not worth it  
  
Put those efforts into JEE mains, enjoy maths, prepare for Mains, for mains, just basic level preparation is enough IF you do it with consistency  
  
Enjoying maths and physics will take you VERY far, just don't think JEE advanced is same thing  
  
Enjoying something is not possible if fear for future is combined with ti  
  
ALSO, if you have the money, PLEASE, please, write SAT and other foreign exams  
Don't ignore foreign universities, see for ALL countries(other than the ones in africa lol)
>i don't want to lose this interest in my JEE Prep

till mains level these books are dogshit, but when preparing for adv true beauty for subjects  comes out.
thinking out of the box and non standard stuff will be required.
tu 27tard hai, abhi tujeh idea bhi nahi hoga PCM kese subjects hai, till class 10th you learn nothing in compared to what you are going to learn in next few years.
but then again what interests you in this subject?
let me give an example, i love physics because i for sure know what's happening...
i can go into as much depth i want and still get answers.
i love maths because it forces me to think out of the box.
and i hate chem because it work on hopes and prayers.
more you deep dive you get one answer i.e it is what it is.
being honest, many students come for the love of subject into PCM but, they don't last as these subjects are actually interesting but require some level of aptitude of it.
and you can't judge it before you try.
Rule 69: Jee and Interest can't be in the same sentence
Pl read the name and year of batches carefully
If I purchase prayas 1.0 2026 will I get access to prayas 2.0 2025 like previous year lectures of prayas 2.0 also?

Bina bio ke kr skte hai kya?
Tk sir number system kyu nahi karvate?
And is mathematical induction removed from jee advanced syllabus?
Why did TK Sir skip the Number System?
This has been bugging me, and I don’t know why.
Although I covered the topic with Sachin Sir in his initial lectures, I couldn’t understand it well and then switched to TK Sir’s Arjuna 2025 lectures.
However, he skipped the topic.
Does it not have weightage in the exam?
Also, has Mathematical Induction been removed now?
I didn’t find it in the 2025 lectures.

L Pee Dabloo 🤡🤡
Ok so I was a student of PW Vidyapeeth Panchkula campus, the faculty were all so trash except one or two.
They even changed the teachers 2-3 times that too of droppers batch (some teachers couldn't even qualify jee mains or aieee that time).
So I posted a Google review regarding same, fast forward to 2-3 days I get a message from a teacher asking me and pressurising to delete that review.
Matlab bache jaaye aisi taisi karwane business nahi rukna chahiye, and then these so called 'revolutionaries' call out Allen and other coachings for doing business.
Waise toh reddit pe itne bewakoof log hote nahi hai but still if anyone thinking to join Vidyapeeth, DON'T.
PS : I have all the SS but not attaching them bcz kahin koi action na lele 😭 but I'll upload them if you guys say so

Anyways was wondering 
What do you guys think of it??

ruk bhai mai bad review de ke aata hu.
muje kaise pressurize krenge![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
pw vidyapeeth liya hi kyu bhai tf it is a very simple rule of indian jee/neet  
offline-allen  
Online-pw
mere sath bhi hua h maine mail kiya tha
Mai to fiitjee mai tha aur tumhe pta hi hai fiitjee vaale publicly kya kuch nhi bol skte![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
Also I had same case but worse can you do the same for my coaching too?
MAINE NISHANT JINDAL KA CUMBACK DEKHA LIYA LEKIN PW VIDYAPEETH KA POSITIVE REVIEW NHI .
I’m in pw too but hamari offline faculty is awesome love them 😍😍
Bach gya papa ne Allen ne bheja tha
I also joined pw vidyapeeth sringar in 11th grade and the faculty was trash then i switched to pw online and found it was so much better.
I had also registered for pw vidyapeeth kota and joined it to jodo for the compulsory Auto debit but , after readings the reviews and the shot things I decided I won't go , but I had already registered and given jodo permission for auto debit, I call pw they told I had to go to the center to get my admission cancelled, which is 1,285 km from my home , so I somehow got it cancelled but a good pw support team lady but the public support no.
Give by pw is absolutely shit , it's better to get support through the app faculty.
Support team is special made to get money out of us.
somewhat same in vidyapeeth kanpur
inki aur akash ki fees barabar hi h
Lol same bro i was a vidyapeeth student and the teachers were trash and they keep changing.
When I complained and gave trash review they are forcing to delete that.
I was also in vidyapeeth chandigarh but teacher were same throughout the year but in starting they were starting teaching so slowly but in end they were covering chapter even in 1 day no enough question practice and how someone can prepare test with all along this and they even call your parents if didn't attend the class .you can't study in library of you wished
 But management was good and physics teacher was also iitian
Bro har jagah common hi tha hamesha se 🤡 Jis coaching ki kitne tarake hote hai aur nayi branches khulte hai waha utne hi jyada quality of teachers girti rehti hai pehle allen for akash aur ab pw more demand less supply of quality teachers to ye sab shit to expected hi thi ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
title se laga LBW ki baat karra
It’s all just for business
U think NEET wale aise teacher ko samajh payenge jisne throughout life JEE batches me pdhaya ho?
Tagdi maths karke chale jayenge, ho jayega “level up” aur NEET walo ko kuch smjh nahi ayega
vidyapeeth bahut bekaat hote hai meri 12th barbaad karva di saalo ne but online ke teachers acche hote hai isiliye pw ko gaali nhi de paata but viyapeeth kabhi mat jaana
I'm did 2year classroom course(NEET) from pw panchkula and i regret taking admission in that institute.
Guys don't go for vidyapeeth panchkula for neet chem teacher is so good
But legit for physics-quality is trash
Have any of you studied from Prashant Jain (unac) sir?
How much improvement have you seen in maths and what was your overall experience?

Apke soch pe to godrej ka tala lagna chahiye
What if IITs gets closed for period of war
Fir toh mai 98%ile pe rank list pe bhi nhi aunga.

Peak covid time pe bhi nhi hua tha cancel

Nta want iits to give admission on the basis of jee mains but So called gawwwd level orgasssm full lagend Attitude status 😋🥰🥰🥰🥰Professor and Chancellor and Top Officials of iit don't want it they believe students who got to iit are superficial so that they need a superficial exam to give them admission
Aisa hua to AIR 564 IIT Pohch jayega![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49199)
What if we all get admission into IIT's based on an online test which is as hard as my life.
Tab to comeback ki jgah cumback ho jayega
"IIT Kanpur has cancelled the war due to JEE Advanced"
kuch nahi hoga padhle.
No one wants math pyqs, whole chemistry and eduniti formula sheet ratafying people in IITs
what if neet walo ko bhi iit meh admission dena allowed ho gaya 

https://preview.redd.it/5j1z5oijfoze1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ca31fde796d554d8e9cfd39738088f5f1d9e0a9
Bhai soch achi hai lekin most probably purane time jaisa ho jaayega.
Matlab har iit ka apna exam.
Even though bahut jyada mushkil hai ki adv cancel ho.
agar aisa hua to mai iit dholakpur mein milunga sabko
Kuch bhi ho jaye exams to conduct karte he hai ye bhadwe🥲🥲
backchodi mat kr laude, mains mein 93.25 percentile hai kya pta advanced mein kuch ho jaaye
Yippppyyy (mere advance ke mock mei 40% aa rhe hai 🥲)
Bhai bacati mat kar
apke soch pe mutna chounga
Aye Aye Tea Aluminium PK ko aukaat dikha degi agar JEE Advanced cancel hua /s
![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)but isse to cheaters iit chale jayenge
What if iits p bomb gir jaye aur iit rahe hi na
what if saari IIT's pe bam gir jaye and bas NIT's rahe![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32180)
I don't think it works that way.
It will just be postponed.
Sapne dekhna acchi baat hai ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Cancel nhi hoga Advance for sure...worst case m delay hone ke chances h 🥲
What if War ki wajeh se sabko hi admission miljayy
Iit mandi toh closed hoga naa
Sapne dekhne aachi baat....🤡
and double droppers still cant get iits so our rank will improve further ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30367)
Teri gand mei bulldozer lagaunga mc agar aisa hua bkl
meri gand mar jayegi aisa hua toh

BHAYA JINX MAT KARNA MAUT HO JAYAGA HAMARA
Fucking fuck fucking fucking fuck fuck.
I can finally get a good IIT.
ye sab bakchodi karne se accha ek do adv.
ke pyq lagalega ko toh 100-200 rank improve ho jayegi
Maut aajayegi lekin yeh nhi hone wala .
What if all IITs get nuked 😶😶😶
They will postpone but cancel.
JEE mains jaise  exam se IIT me selection nahi hota.
bhai mere papa ne galti se teri post padhli reddit pe aur isko sach maan liya aur merko aake bolre the ki "adv cancel hogya toh mains ke rank se hogi admission"
I had this thought yesterday then I fucking realised I'm going to get nothing on 98%ile
STFU if that happens im fucked.
i prepared for adv from 11th, am getting <1k wale ranks in pyps...
in mains i got 6k rank
What if iit's par missile gir jayein?
My chances of getting into an iit this year is dim but if advance is somehow postponed for like a week or two mein kutte jese 16 ghante roz padnunga, <1000 Category rank (104 marks 2024 mein) laake, Caste certificate ki shakti pe kisi Gen1 IIT mein Mech lunga [mains percentile 93.10%ile]
buss bhola kare thoda postpone ho jaye

Got CSE at UIET Chandigarh
Should I go for it?
Hey everyone,
I just found out I’m getting CSE at UIET Chandigarh (rank ~45k in JEE).
I’d really appreciate some help from current students, alumni, or anyone who knows about the college.
I have a few questions and concerns:

How’s the overall reputation and environment of UIET?
How is the CSE department specifically?
Faculty, coding culture, peer group?
What are the placements and internships like for CSE students?
How’s the hostel life, food/mess, and campus vibe?
Is it easy to get involved in clubs, hackathons, or side projects?
Any regrets or things to be careful about before joining?
Would you suggest taking this or going for something else via CSAB or a drop?
Just want to make an informed decision before locking the seat.

First NCERT, then read your modules (for chemistry).
For physics reading NCERT is not required (except some misc material which your teachers will tell you before mains).
For maths, just solve problems.
ncert is for reading and understanding basics.
module is for building up complex stuff on that basics.
you have to do both.
however, in general i have seen most start with doing both, but then are not able to sustain - in that case, go for module directly and ncert if you do not understand.

Should I study more?
I am currently in class 10th.
I joined pre foundation coaching in class 9th and completed several chapters In pcb syllabus of class 11th.
In class 10th, the coaching is not teaching class 12th topics in depth, should I study the left portion by myself or just keep practicing what I am studying and studied earlier?
My schedule is pretty full so that's why I am confused if putting that effort is worth it, I have school from 6:30 am to 2:30 PM.
Then, I have my coaching from 5pm to 9pm.
I don't want to burnt out but I also don't want to break the flow I had in class 9th.

I'm leaving my home to stay somewhere else to pursue my childhood dream of being an engineer as I was fascinated by machines and technology.
I'm going to a coaching for this and hope to make this dream come true and my parents were supportive and spent a huge sum for my education 

This feels quite big but I'm still trying my best...and I hope fellow aspirants victory too (also I'm not gonna use internet or a smartphone for the next 2 years)

get into a good offline coaching and follow your teachers and modules completely
Maths - Arihant Skills in Mathematics.
OC - MS Chauhan and Akshay Choudhary.
IOC - NCERT + notes.
Physical Chem - Notes.
Solve PYQs if you have attended lectures and have nothing else to do.
Bhai for god's sake please wiki padhle 🙏🙏  
tu bohot ganda wala bully hone wala hai
Join offline coaching rather than online.
bhai pls don't go for fancy books  
physics ke liye - hcv at best (I'll recommend modules koi bhi achi coaching ke bas)  
physical - modules that's it  
oc - ms chauhan at best (modules krliyo pehle) + ncert pls ache se krlio  
ioc - ncert bas krle bhai bhot ache se, daily revision of ncert  
pyq's krliyo saare achee se bilkul.
don't fucking skip tests at all I repeat.
Do lectures, notes, module/pyq book for questions, revise, give test.
Do these 5 stuff with consistently
Offline coaching join krlena  
koi ek subject ka chutiya teacher hoga toh usko bas online krliyo , parallel mai coaching.
bas daily targets complete krna, and don't beat yourself if you couldn't complete it.
Enjoy krna rest krna, bkchodi krna sab kuch krna,   
padhai bhi krna,   
I guarantee you that bas tu consistency se padhega na , masti krne ke saath bhi ,   
you'll be able to get 98-99 percentile pkka
Should I join PW Arjuna or local coaching in my city(Kolkata)
Can't join offline coaching like allen due to financial issues.

pw arjuna with allen module (if u can find hardcopy)
pw arjuna would be better.
its because - as you are in 11th - and if you dont have much idea -> go for online pw.
then you can again change in 12th if you did not find it to be good.
kaunsa local coaching bhai you can ask me ive been in some and other friends have been in other coachings.
I would say only legit coaching in kolkata Would be BB sir for physics(from personal experience).
Dont even think of getting admission in bagchi sir's class that guy never completes his syllabus it'll be upto you.
Private colleges suggest kardo yaar
Total budget 15-18L tak hai everything including mess and hostel.

Indian Students Are Running a Race with a 20-Year Handicap- Why Are We Okay with This?
If you’ve ever spent hours chasing the “perfect” certification, only to realize it’s irrelevant the second you step into the real world.
Or maybe you’ve crammed for exams that taught you how to ace a test but left you clueless about how to land a job.
If you’re an Indian student, it probably does—because we’re all stuck playing catch-up in a system that’s 20 years behind the curve.
Let’s be real: everyone knows our education system is fucked up.
It’s a relic, built for a world of stable 9-to-5s and factory jobs that don’t exist anymore.
We’re memorizing equations while the world demands AI, critical thinking, and adaptability.
In a global race where being ahead is everything, we’re handed a curriculum that’s basically a time capsule from the early 2000s.
No one’s there to tell us how to bridge the gap.
We’re left scrolling through LinkedIn, Google, and random “top 10” lists, hoping something sticks.
The stats don’t lie: 29% of our educated youth are jobless, not because they’re lazy, but because what we’re taught doesn’t match what’s needed.
We’re mastering archery while employers are looking for drone pilots.
Meanwhile, India’s median age is 28.8- we’re a young country with insane potential, but it’s slipping away because no one’s handing us a map.
I got so fed up with this mess that I started tinkering with a side project: https://careeroadmap.com .
It’s an AI tool that’s supposed to act like a personal career GPS, figuring out your skills, interests, and goals, then pointing you to the workshops, competitions, or skills that actually matter.
I’m not saying it’s the answer (yet-it’s rough around the edges), but it’s born from the same frustration you’ve probably felt.
Imagine if we had something that said, “Hey, skip that generic cert; this niche competition will get you noticed instead.” Wouldn’t that change the game?
Here’s the meta part: I’m not trying to pitch you a polished product.
It’s early, and I’d rather build it with people like you than pretend I’ve got it all figured out.
So:

What’s the one thing our education system screwed you over on when it came to your career?
If an AI could guide you, what would you want it to prioritize-skills, opportunities, or something else?
Realistically, how much would you pay monthly for something that cuts through the bullshit and saves your time?
If we don’t rethink how we navigate this broken system, we’re just handing the next generation the same outdated playbook.
Maybe it’s time we demand more, not just from our schools, but from ourselves.
What do you think-can we outsmart the handicap, or are we doomed to keep running in circles?

Query about NEET drop
So I didn’t really study properly in my 11th and 12th grade, to the point where I'm not really satisfied with my preparation.
I was studying for jee basically and not for neet, so i was kinda used to that.
Mind you i didnt study properly.
I decided to study for neet, and take a drop.
I seriously dont know how to go about.
There are so many options.
Should i take some coaching, or individual tuition.
I hated coaching, thats for sure and i know, how to feels cause i was in one for my eleventh and twelth.
Buty im scared that, individual tuition wont be enough to get a government medical college.
I dont want to take more than one drop.
I really want to give my all this time.
I attempted this year's neet, and honestly, felt like if i had revised and actually paid a little attention, i'd have been able to solve the questions.
I did not find the paper hard, i just found my preparations inadequate.
Like, i just gave up, and did not revise 11th at all.
12th also i did not do atall.
I basically went into the examination hall, as if to give my first mock test.
So this is my situation and i want someone to tell me how to navigate this drop year, so that i get a gmc.

this just goes on to show how weak there Neet faculty was.
how much they lacked the In depth understanding of the concepts that they had to pull teachers from the jee faculty when the paper was slightly difficult one time.
Isn't this disrespect for MRsir
Last Minute Doubt Clearance for JEE Advanced
I qualified JEE Advanced '21 with a 2.5k rank and have a BS-MS degree in Math and Physics from IISER Pune.
Since Advanced is only a week away, most of you probably know where you stand.
Instead of learning new things, you are revising everything in the syllabus you are confident in.
Maybe you think you are well-versed in a certain topic, but looking through previous year questions ends up a hit or miss.
What you need is a certainty that a question coming from a topic you have done, is going to be nothing but a hit.
I am offering private doubt solving sessions of questions/concepts from the JEE Advanced syllabus that you might find so daunting that your first instinct is to skip them.
If you want that edge over your competition in solving that one difficult question, which can be the difference of thousands of ranks, then DM me with your problem, and I would provide you with the conceptual clarity you need to confidently attempt anything they might throw at you.

You have only few months remaining with you, so you have to make out the best of them.
Delete all distractions around you, IG, YT - everything.
Let you parents money and sacrifices come into your mind alongside.
Can't you study for them ?
Don't forget the sweat and blood you put into this shit for a good rank.
Don't loose self confidence and self belief.
Build discipline and consistency and you will surely do well.

Which app do y'all use to track the number of questions everyday?

A couple of days ago, my teacher told me to track and analyse how many questions I did each day, so if there is an app to track that, it'd be very helpful.

Doubt in Mole concept (247F)
So we know that 1 mole of H2O molecule have 6.022×10²³ molecules of H2O right?
Then 1 mole of H2 atom have 2×6.022×10²³ atoms 

Similarly for oxygen, O atom's 1 mole is equals to 6.022×10²³ atoms

So if we sum up all these H2 and O mole atoms are we going to get the results same as 1 mole of H2O molecules?
If yes then how?
(Ik bhai this sawaal is so dumb but I can't help it, idk if ye sawaal hi glt hai tohhhh 😭😭😭)

A dozen of banana contains 12 pieces of banana.
Now that banana constitute of some eatable part and some non eatable part( chilka).
So if you peel of a dozen of banana then you get 1 dozen eatable banana and 1 dozen chilka.
Suming up all these tell me how many dozens of banana you have??
1 mole H2  me 6.022x10²³ "molecules" hai 
And H ke 2x6.022x10²³ "atoms"
Similarly 1 mole H2O me 6.022x10²³ "molecules" hai and 3x6.022x10²³ total "atoms"
So,if you sum up the atoms of H2 and O you will get number of "atoms" in H20 not "molecules"
Eventually toh same hi elements rhe utne hi number mein.
Tumne bs ginne ka tareeka badal diya.
Like pehle tum har ek particle ko alag alag gin the the ab teen particle ko ek sath gin rhe ho
Yes , 1 molecule of h20 has 3 atoms in total....so if you see , 2+1=3

Solve chapterwise for JEE Advanced.
Solve JEE Mains according to your wish but I suggest solve in one go, so it would be better to solve after completing a chapter.

Experience ai motion institute
I have been going to Motion Institute for the last 2 weeks.
Last Monday, the faculty conducted a small OMR-based test on the topics covered in the first 10 days (Motion in a Straight Line, Trigonometry 1, and IUPAC).
The test was easy.
After 2 days, the results were declared, but my name was not on the list.
I asked the management about this, and they told me that I had scored -40 out of 300.
I requested to see my OMR sheet, and when they matched it with the given answer key, my answers were correct.
I informed the management about this, and they told me that, by mistake, my OMR was matched with the JEE (Class 11) answer key.
When I asked them to recheck it properly, my actual score turned out to be 170 out of 300.

For that round almost quarter of seats left last year  
Most people still don't know B.Tech is there, or can't afford it  
You have a pretty good chance
Check last round cutoff
Check last round cutoff
Now they have made it that best in JEE adv and mains rank is taken.
That will probably affect it.
You have a good chance brotha
This year they have started admissions through JEE Advanced and Olympiads too.
So, if luck is in your favour, maybe you can get CSE there.

58 topo ki salami
HAPPYYY BIRTHDAYYYY STAY HAPPY✨
Happy birthday bro cake tu mere adress ko bhej do
happi birthday send cake plej
Please Helpp me 😭🙏🏻
I am 19 years old and I appeared for NEET 2025, but it didn’t go well at all.
As you all know, the paper was quite tough.
This was my second drop, and now my parents and relatives are pressuring me to take admission in any semi-government medical college, which costs around 30–40 lakhs for the entire course.
That’s the biggest issue for me.
I come from a middle-class family, and I know that this is not a small amount—it would be very difficult for my parents to manage, especially since I also have a younger sister.
I want to take my third and final drop.
I'm confident that this time I will give my 101%, and I’ll accept whatever the result may be.
Even if I enter medical college next year at the age of 20, I don’t think that’s too late.
But I don’t think I’ll be able to get into a semi-government college, and I can’t bring myself to say this to my family.
What should I do?
I really need your guidance.

not demotivating, but didn’t you think that I would give my 100% for the first and second drops too?
Gharwalo ko mana kr le lo drop also next time fill other forms too (for just in case situations) because this is a viscious cycle and jitni jaldi iss se move on kr lo utna acha hai.
And ik it isn't easy to go in these high fees institutes when you have younger siblings, so I'd suggest take time ,gharwalo ko smjhao and then give your 100% to it
can i rely on csab last year closing ranks ?
does it change significantly every year ?

Meri bhi dimag ki chod rkhi hai iit bs chemistry mein bhi admission krwadenge prr appreciate na krenge kabhi
Parents can be rigid they want the best for u but doesn't always know what is best for u.
Listen to everything they say, js don't let it take a toll on your mind
Same situation like you.I am also having same college options.my parents are also obsessed with iit tag.i also want a pause now.i have lost literally all my friends nothing apart from studies.No one to talk to.i am mentally done now.like literally i see my so called friends(who used to be) together enjoying and here is me who lost all.
Same academic situation as you but my parents are kindoff supportive.
I told them I am now burned out and IIT me mostly lower branch milegi, isse better h dtu nsut me electric/ece lelu.
They said agar kuch acha nahi mila to bilkul le liyo, but last 10 din h, ekbar try karle, yeh regret toh nahi rahegi ki try nahi kiya.
Mere marks bhi 100-120 range me hi h, I am ngl excited for nsut ece more lmao....
same but mere 98.9 :((((((((((((((((((
Bro I don't know what will I do if I ve worked hard all these days for just getting some low branch with just iit tag for social acceptance even if I get that iit tag and not what I am interested in studying I would feel like my persona is getting shallow
Bhai jabse reddit pe aayi hu esi stories dekh ke ghar walo ke liye pyaar badh gya hai
Same situation getted 97.8 in 2nd attempt.
Kal hi sunna agar thodi aur mehnat karta toh nit me cs milta aur abhi padh IIT nikal.
I got 77 percentage in gujarat board and I'm satisfied I pass the cutoff.
Still my father mentality is he doesn't care about jee score he doesn't know the value but he already scolded me for getting this low (btw 98.96 in 10 guj board).
Aaj hi baat hui thi ki surat me ece mil rha hai mummy boli lele wese bhi upper branch hai lunga hi.
Mene bas bola waha pe basketball badminton ground hai bus swimming pool nhi hai🥲.
Bas isi baat pe sunn liya tu college pe jaake YHI sb karna padhna bilkul mat.
Me surat me hi rehta hu but svnit surat me hostel me Jake rahunga ghar par nhi rehne wala!!
4 saal shanti se jiyunga khud concentrate karunga aapne Passion pe.
And when I say I lost my friends and i feel bad seeing them having fun whereas I have to work Hard so much all these years then my mom is like ha ha tu ghumne aur maza Masti par hi dhyan de isiliye tera selection nhi hota😭🥲
meanwhile my father jo abhi se hi kah rhe ki NITs ki circuital branches bhi achi hoti hain..
bhai mujhko nhi pata tere ghar mein kaise haalaat hain (if you get beat up or emotionally traumatized) but i'd say ek baar tamash macha de ki tujhko advance nhi dena.
I left everything family functions my friends social life my happiness and worked day and night just to secure a seat so that I too could have fun without my parents taunting me but rn I see myself as a failure with no one by my side except depression and the endless amount of tears cried in silence
Bhaii JEE karna hi nhi chahiye..it really disturbs your mental peace and every jee aspirant goes through that who studies sincerely
Guys I just wanted a little help to know which college and branch would be a better option.
DTU electrical or NSUT ece or BIT mesra cse or any other relevant options would also be appreciated (I have a crl of 27k and an obc rank of 7k)

Since I am asking this matlab advance and bits ki taiyari toh hai nahi so...yeah that's all.
Any kind of help would be extremely appreciated.
(Guys this is my first post on reddit so please agar kuch mistake ho gayi ho toh roast mat karna🫠)

Regarding RAJIV GANDHI NATIONAL AVIATION UNIVERSITY
Need insights about 

***RAJIV GANDHI NATIONAL AVIATION UNIVERSITY***

Anyone here studies/knows anyone studying/has any info about this college?
It is offering BTECH-Aerospace engineering through jee and **cuet** mode, but I cant particularly find any info regarding it.
If anyone has idea regarding the ***past year cutoffs*** and more about this institute, kindly enlighten.
THANKS IN ADVANCE(honest reviews please)

Unpopular opinion: Jee teachers provide better conceptual clarity
As a neet dropper I recently started checking out some jee teachers (what neet 25 do to u) and istg I js suddenly understand everything better, no shade to anyone but i feel like I'm gonna stick to jee teachers for now.

But yaha pe logo ki ek lakh rank aati hai so they blame neetards for not qualifying
Har cheez me dusre pe blame daalne ki aadat hai inhe.
Apne sar pe kabhi nahi lenge apni galti
why dont people understand ki ek avg NEET wala JEE me nahi la pata 95%+ its the top NEET people who can pulloff these stuff 

but in logo ko bass ek copium chahiye apni nakamyabi kisi aur pe dalne ki
Did you just fucking use AI on me?
JEE aspirants have 3 subjects to score from upto their potential.
whereas neetards only have 2.
If the still clear the cutoff and get seats in normal eng.
colleges as stated by people in other comments, that just shows how underqualified the students were who wouldve originally gotten those seats, despite having a bonus pool of extra 100 marks more than the neetards giving the paper 

(im a jeetard btw)
I only believe in one thing, "make love not war".
If a neet guy is beating you at jee, you didn't deserve to get selected anyway.
I am sorry, this is the bitter truth
I don't wanna argue but it also affects the no.
of people qualifying for JEE ADVANCED.
Although the people with less percentile of qualifying Advanced is less but never zero.
Everybody forgot about that all...untill you just reminded them....thanks ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|49427)![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32179)
agar teacher se itna farak pad raha hota toh sabke acche marks na aate?
aur rahi baat inke paper dene ki to jee itna halwa nahi ki sirf phy aur chem karke 150+ mardo aur jin neetard ke acche percentile aati hai ye manko chalo unki neet mein bahut acche marks aane hai aur aise log bahut kaam hai so chill maaro aur padhai kar

sab kuch aacha hoga

neetards ki mkc bkl h saare
We are concerned about those jinka in chutiyo ki wajah se advanced ka cutoff reh jaata hai ...
yeah, idk why people dont get it, simple hi to hai
what about advanced qualification though?
if a jeetard gets 93%ile he wont get selected but a neetard will be selected and most probably wont give jee advanced
As a neet aspirant myself(pcmb) when I'm getting 96 percentile I am putting behind some child below the cutoff similarly together all of us are, but if I was pcb and couldn't participate in counselling, there was no point putting back one child.
The opportunity to sit for advanced gets snatched for them, and it doesn't matter wo 92 laya paya ya nai, uski haq maari gayi, who knows he could have worked enough to secure his seat in the given time?
the probability is never zero

  
pcb students giving jee doesn't matter if they score below cutoff.
is it that hard to understand?
Abe to fir kya engineering college me seat khali reh jati h??
Aisa thodi hota h
If you can't score more than a NEET aspirant in an engineering exam, they deserve that engineering seat more than you do.
That is the purpose of the exam, to find deserving candidates.
Yes, JEE mains can be better designed, especially physics.
But you're the problem if you can't score better.
It's not our fault.
As a neetard I also want a backup and now after this years paper I might use my jee rank to get into bioengineering.
It's also to be considered that yall have an advantage in jee and in college cuz we have to study the WHOLE of maths again to stay relevant in engineering colleges.
Holy fuck touch grass

  
5 din hogye neet ko
You are assuming that neetards don't join engineering colleges , I have 4 of my 6 neet friends who studies PCB  and M(Just for boards , enough marks to pass) all their 11 and 12 and joined Engineering colleges ..
so seats do get affected.
But I also agree completely blaming them is not justified, only nta can fix this by changing weightage of maths or decreasing difficulty..
Can anyone send me the pdf for the solution of book.
In great need of it.

Should I take a drop ?
Hi I(18F) gave JEE Mains this year.
Gave WBJEE, expecting 6K rank, getting IEM CSE at this rank.
My basics are clear, just lack of practice and time resulted in bad marks.
Expecting  92% in boards(CBSE).

Nishant Jindal is certified Chutiya.
BUT MR sir aise bekar ka attitude jhad kr bhi sahi nahi kr rhe the.
Why make th3se dumb fking predictions if you are not going to say even sorry.
Sir should have just take accountability "Dekho bacho, last 5 6 years ke pattern se hume laga ki Physics easy end pr ayegi pr NTA ne ulta hi krdiya, am sorry for my wrong predictions" bol dete.
when the guy you hate, makes a valid point ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|32193)
Is he wrong tho?
Well he isn't wrong this time tbh , bc 5 to 6 times aur sawal pdho answer tick kro?
For the first time jindal sahi lagra
no comment on nishant jindal but MR sir deserves to be trolled i have never seen any good teacher saying things like  " NTA ki AUKAAT nahi ki mere notes se bahar paper banaye" and "97% paper is hi video se hoga" i mean please respect ur position ,,, aap ke teacher ho jisko bhot bacche apna ideal maante hai aise baccho ko false hopes dena aur itna arrogant ghamandi hona ek teacher ko nahi shobha deta ......
as an experienced teacher he should know ki exam ko 100% predict karna impossible hai and thinking ki woh jo kahenge woh hi hoga is pure foolishness and uske baad apne aap ko justify karna is alag level of chutiyapa....
honestly mujhe pw ki alakh sir ki 2018 ki hi video acchi lagti hai ( it is literally gold) and rajwant sir ki iske alawa koi nahi .....
idk unke teachers ke saath kya wrong hai bus hawa main badi badi baate karna and woh jo results ke baad neet vs jee karvate hai toppers se ( jinke edit bante hai) bhai kya chutiyapa hai ye .....
sahi toh ke rha hai
I hate Jindal cuz iske chutiyap ke peche 2 mahine 11th mein waste kiye 

Magar he is correct this time around, unfortunately 

Sir ne umeed aur neet physics decoding ko itna zyaida overhype kiya
as a physics teacher who is teaching what is a physical quantity and then saying "neet ka paper 5-6 time tough aaya tha compared to jee ka paper" - he should know whether "toughness" is a physical quantity that can be measured?
or is it just a random opinion which can be made to look like 69% accurate as per random factors to decide toughness.
its just stupid actually.
when jee went from paper based to computer based - some teachers gave the argument - paper is tough because its now cbt and all.
i am saying that this toughness and all is so subjective it cannot be measured.
neet paper could be tough for students not having centers nearby to their residence and they need to travel in heat and get exhausted and then write the exam.
its absolutely wrong to be speculative being a science teacher and again enforcing that your speculation is right.
in fact - entire scientific temper is about not speculating or atleast not being proud if your tukkas work.
Apna batch bhi toh promote Krna h ish jindal bhadwe ko
jindal is right was right.
Jee mains se 5 to 6 times tough hai 👺
Neet wale har jagah rr krte rhte hain
WHats wrong jindal say !
esa attitude leke chal rha tha NTA ne barbad kar diya
He simply knows that the kind of students who take admission in online platforms like PW and dickride their teachers are the exact kind who would take his courses and dickride him.
It’s simply a business move of criticising your competition to gain a few students.
Ab ye Allen ko to criticize karega nahi kyuki wo bacche wese bhi iske courses nahi lene wale.
Kyunki mr sir is a teacher that's why unko gaali dena isn't justified but nj to official chutiya hai ek batch kya laa diya sabki gaand mein dum krke rkha hai plus mr sir is idiotically a joker neet mein sirf  confidence aur attitude se kaam nhi chalta sometimes you have to bow
It's obvious, he also runs a coaching brand, and his biggest competitor is pw, he is putting story ki pw ke teachers bss bolte hai ki hamare notes se aayega lekin aata nhi, toh join our batch blah blah blah, marketing pov is very good move, but I don't like that jindal so fuck him anyways.
I can freakin bet on the fact ki ab NJ apna neet batch launch karega thode time me.....🧔🏾‍♀️
Clown to Clown communication be like...
Broken watch is right twice a day type shi
Not a PW ka 14,but the thing is that MR Sir’s notes have proven to be effective for the last few years in neet,this time it did not work out and Jindal found this to be his opening to promote his batch and company.Abb next year neet ke paper ke baad hee we can comment that who is actually right here
Sbke sb chor hai saale..woh chillate hai chillane do pehle chilayenge phir shant ho jayenge
Nishant jindal ki mkc 
Uss bkl ko bhi apna course he bhechna hai
Nishant se bada chutiya ye MR hai , pahele toh isko padhana nahi ata though mein saleem hi dekhta hu but ek bar dekhe the iske , banda har type ke question ke liye formula ratata hai koi approach nahi.
Jindal kitna bhi bakchod ho but faltu ki gand nahi marta plus MR toh class mein or chutiyap karta hai , kabhi feet chatega , hilate ho ,etc.
Bro MR Sir me notes pichle kuch saalo se work karrhe the.
Aur is saal hogyi galti, itna troll karna sahi nhi h.
Aur wese bhi PW doesn't deserve to be trolled.
These JEE teachers so uff......
Abb Jindal jyada kr rha h..
Hype chahiye sabko and they know Mr is not a tough one he gets mad at small things and if they call him out now he will reply and this will get bigger
Iss baar toh sahi baat Kari ha Jindal ne
Yeh bkl khud kab maafi mangega?
🙏🏻😭Itne salo se notes mat bnao bol raha tha mc ab kya hogya isko
https://preview.redd.it/wo03i9f5krze1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9e05ec2d80397303824fdaf14263d5ee43f7b59

Tum dono ki mkchuu..
He always tried to bring pw down he don't care about neet or neet students..mr sir ne faltu me prediction ki baat ki usko iss chiz se mauka mil gya..he is still a clown 🤡
nj sahi bol raha hai be ye pura palat gaya chutiya  
jee main se 5-6 times tough tha wowwwww
"Har koi paper nikal lega to social media pe gussa kon nikalega"
dono pagal hai ek ka marketing dusre ka ego , par chutiyape pe 247 hi age hai
Inko paper leak krke bhi dedoge to usme bhi khot nikal lenge ye bhadwe
Nishant Jindal has most punchable face in Edu Industry
he is just trying to grab neet students
jee se tough , ye chutiya hogya h kyaa![img](emote|t5_311ttu|30176)

Recently i appeared on a scholorship exam conducted by coaching narayana, confined to a specific caste- bhumihar,There was too much crowd at the exam centre and it was conducted at many places in jharkhand,from what it seemed, everyone was literally 10x smarter and intelligent than me cuz I'm below average student,I gave exam cuz of my parents,and i didn't even study anything,i hardly  solved half the question in which half were absolutely wrong,sill I'm one of those 28 filtered students out of 200-300 students,it doesn't make sense ,now they're going to take viva to further filter 10 out of these 28 students, I've no interest to study at  that coaching,situated in another state ,This must be some sort of advertisement or whatever,this is fked  up

Narayana is only good if you join in class 11th, a main branch, with good faculty, like Hyderabad, chennai, Ahmedabad, jaipur, Delhi-Kalusarai/Lajpat Nagar.
And the hostel programme is very very painful, they force students to study upwards of 12-16 hours a day, have a very strict schedule, and there are stories of them beating children as well.
Tldr- join only if - 11th+, a topper batch, main branch, don't join hostel programme
If u r a ranker type of student then it's good otherwise if u r an avg type of student then pls pls don't go
it's very good but only if you're in the top batch in a major branch
Depends on ur city bc 2 saal barbad hogye mere jhat bhar ki pdhai nhi hoti

while its true that pw does manipulative marketing which will be pointed out on a neutral platform like reddit - its also true that pw is as good as any other top / best coaching in india in one of the most affordable price.
its only a matter of time, when these teachers buying luxury cars and all will push the prices on customers.

although i align more with dc pandey ig
Dc pandey would be good
dc pandey, hc verma just has 4-5 good questions of total 60-65 per chapter, that ratio in dc pandey is much better
Dc pandey better for sure, but I'd suggest not following books at all rather pyqs are really nice and coaching material is more than sufficient, if you're not in a coaching dc pandey is a good choice.

Help a 12th loser to get a college
So I am a student from the hsc board (2024-25), I got 60.67% marks in board exams and I scored 73%ile in jee mains, I couldn't attend mht cet due to personal reasons, now i am looking for a decent college to do my bachelor's degree in, i don't have a specific degree that i wanna do, btech, be, or bsc all are fine but the thing is i want to do computer science, so considering my low percentage I know it will be hard to get a good college but generally money is not the problem (unless it's like 10lakh per year kind of money then that's not possible, 2-3 or even 4 lakhs per year is manageable), the issue is location, I want to be in mumbai only, if anyone can suggest me some good colleges in mumbai, for cse where there's decent placement and is recognised, cause I have been learning to code and stuff since 10th, I want to do bachelor's here and then move abroad for my master's and even further studies, and I was so indulged in skill development I got so busy and score badly 

Any help is very appreciated, please help me as I can't find any decent college and online reviews pe bharosa hona band ho gaya hai kyuki sala wo to amity ko top college batate hai Mumbai ka
