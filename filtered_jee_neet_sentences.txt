84	maine ye chiz dekhi neet walo me randirona krne ki skills jee walo se zyada h bc ye scams aur cheating ke matter bss reddit pe hi khtm hojate h
85	kya pata iit kanpur se setting karli ho up se hai wo imgemotet5311ttu32180
86	i think consistency is a card which was only used in jee mains only 1 session not in 12th boards 68 in 2025
87	70 10th probably failed 12th in icse board ya shayed iska 75 clear nahi hua now reappearing from up board for 12th and jee dropper nahi hai ye 12th is saal paas karega
88	ho sktajee advance ki bhi setting baitha di ho isne
89	let me add more context to it he got less than 75 in his boards and he cant join any of the iits and nits even though he cheated
90	ah well then thats a different story i personally would still give him benefit of doubt because some people do perform way better in an mcq exam because they dont have the skill of expressing their knowledge in words
91	wo up ka hai and iit kanpur bhi up me hi hai so possible imgemotet5311ttu49429
92	i truly understand what she must be going throughsecuring a good rank in jee but missing out due to eligibility criteria is heartbreaking
93	if her heart is set on iits or nits please encourage her not to lose hope
94	she can appear for improvement exams this yearjust in the subjects where she fell shortand give jee another solid attempt next year
95	so in my honest opinion going for a drop along with improvement exams seems like the best path forward for her

239	i have already taken drop for jee and was motivated enough
240	but if i got so low in boards what can i do in jee
241	bhai ek genuine question hai i am also interesd in improvement exam but uska result to august mein aata hai and tab tak to saari colleges ki counselling band ho jaati hai mostly private colleges ki band ho hi jaati hai to tab kya karenge
242	prepare for jee do your best in it
243	rneet just hit 49000 members
244	we have also been able to reduce the neet exam posters thanks to the moderators and automated tools
245	for the past few days we had way less neet exam posters
246	not a neet myself but i think u guys are kinda chill
247	someone share neetbux please
248	we could pitch in our neetbux and buy an island to establish a neet commune
249	we have added some filters to indian neet exam posts
250	now posts that contain potential indian neet exam words will be flagged and sent to moderators who will review it manually
251	if the posts are not related to the exams and are genuine neet posts moderators will approve it manually
252	most neet posts dont have to worry about this but if your posts are genuine and dont get approved please message the mods
253	note most posts wont be affected and will be posted immediately but if you use certain words like neet exam question papers physics chemistry etc it can flag the filters
254	we reviewed the most commonly used words in the exam posts to setup the filter
255	i remember last years indian neet week probably the most active time on this sub because of all the spam lol
256	what if youre an indian neet whose negative selfworth is tied to having failed the neet exam
257	the neet exam flair is for automoderator
258	we have already mentioned in the description that this is not a sub for the exam they dont read it
259	the neet exam flair is working well
260	we have managed to delete several exam posts
261	genuine neet posts will not be banned regardless of the country you are from but if it is related to the exam it will be
262	ill give everyone universal basic income youre welcome neets
263	i have no strong drive and desire combined with high levels of courage which is why i was probably content being neet for a few years
264	im surprised why you have these dreams as a neet
265	most neets here seem like lazy zero aspiration types with very little desire to do anything expensive
266	it could be as simple as you never got a gf and that demotivated you down to your core or made you look for satisfaction in other things like everything that being a neet is
267	but i love being a neet and have been for the past year
268	besides theyd probably end up with whatever genetics made me a neet and hate me for birthing them lol
269	but my neetesque lifestyle is going to come to an end either parents find out i dropped out move back home commit try school again inevitably drop out again commit straight up just commit or get my life together and its scaring me so badly
270	is anyone else here an involuntary neet
