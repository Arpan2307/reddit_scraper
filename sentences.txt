can someone tell me if they got their admit card in the mail or the comments are just speculating ki mail main mil jaega last year jaisa
gormint ko sabse chutiye server wali website bana ne ka award dedo koi
Though JEE Adv is one of the only few (maybe only one) entrance exams in India that release the admit cards at the exact said time, (10 A.M), those 3200/- was a total waste when they couldn't maintain a site for just around 2 lakh students when JEE Main and NEET sites are handling for 15 lakh+ students.
I don't know whether the JEE Adv site is maintained by themselves or NIC like JEE Main and NEET.
Yet, its been more than 3 hours and site is just down forever!
why is it showing error
Bhai ab bhi nhi khul rha 1.5 Ghnta hogya still...
Is this Ubuntu by any chance?
Or any other distro?
nhi khul rha, kisi ka khula kya?
why the fuck it is showing reg.
number is incorrect believe me i got 43 percentile in jee mains(gen)
Link open nahi raha

bc aisa lagta hai kl hi toh mains diya tha ye advance 13 din mein kaise aane wala hai
I have mixed feelings about the fact that only 13 days are left…ek taraf exam khatm hone ki khushi dusra thoda emotional bhi ho raha hun kyunki ye 2 saal ka mehnat hai aur ye time baad mein nostalgia ban jayegi….
i think advanced ka paper to aj hi ho gya🫡
bas 11 days...the buzzz
bhopadike yahan toh serious ho jaao countdown dekh ke!!
Mujhe advance ke liye bilkul hopes nahi hai😭😭
Mere mains mai bhi bas 94.6 hi bane
Anyone else like me😭😭

He went to kashmir and we never talked again
after 10th they left the school and when they did i realised they were draining the life outta me , glad things ended and i found better people
Entire group dropped me over a small misinterpretation of words.
I apologised and tried reaching out few times but no proper response ever.
Only talking we do is over tweets and replies
lost all friends after switching school and couldn't make new ones there
she, just left me and after 2 days I heard that she took her life.
well he got together w my ex so 🙏🏽
😍🤲🏻 my friend group though i found new friends js coz i was in vn w other friends and they locked the vc (fyi the vc was locked and it wasn't my vc and i didn't even see their texts when they asked to join) they said i betrayed them and started ignoring me
He started avoiding me friendship faded away inconspicuously
he had feelings for me nd that destroyed the friendship![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30120)
every frndship of mine ended(some evn in bad ways).
Atp m hi manhoos hu
Well it happened near the end of 10th grade didn't bother me that much
We literally talked for hours, midnight (he was a morning guy but still we chatted), gave me a cute nickname, always praised me for whatever I do, had a soft side for me dk why, always paid attention, curious to know me, overall a nice guy until I found out he is already in a relationship.
She fucked up the situation lol.
Now they're both together, went to some trips, doing shit, and here am writing this nonsense here LMFAO.
Hope he's having fun 🩹
This happend to me 3 times over the last 3 years, with 3 different people.
Okay, this is gonna be long 😮‍💨

So back in class 6, I joined a new school and became best friends with this girl.
I had a crush on this senior guy (let’s call him A), and she was the only person I told.
In class 7, we were placed in different sections, so we only met during breaks.
Then one day during tiffin, I found out people were teasing her for having a crush on A.
I was so shocked because...
She’d always blush when he was mentioned and had started ignoring me.
Soon she became besties with another girl and distanced herself from me.
Later I found out she and A were in some weird situationship.
I still liked him back then, but I slowly started moving on.
We didn’t talk at all during those years.
But when school reopened in class 10, she just acted like everything was normal—like none of that ever happened.
Apparently, she’d started dating A’s best friend back in class 8, and they were still together.
That guy was super toxic—like, even the teachers had given up on him 💀.
We had another fallout at the end of 10th, but again, with the new year, she came back like everything was chill.
In 11th, she broke up with that guy, started acting all heartbroken, constantly seeking attention from every guy, and again...
For one project, she straight up told me there was “no space” in her group—but added two guys who were her friends.
So I started ignoring her too.
She had a new best friend (let’s call her T), whom I didn’t vibe with at first...
but somehow, I became friends with T.
That really pissed her off 😬.
She tried manipulating T by telling her I was jealous of her, spreading lies etc.
But T didn’t fall for it and started ignoring her too.
That’s pretty much how things ended between us.
She still went around saying stuff about me to others, but I honestly just ignored her.
In class 12, she suddenly decided to be “serious” about studies and claimed she’d outscore me in two subjects I’d always topped in.
It was a one-sided competition atp 😭 After the first unit test, she got a reality check—scored less than me in *every* subject—and dropped the act.
Later, she started dating some guy who’s apparently a CEO of some company (don’t ask me how 💀).
We didn’t talk at all, but a few months back, she randomly started talking to me again—nothing major, just small convos because we had the same project group.
not exactly a breakup story, but definitely a toxic friendship.
Not sure if anyone will read all this but thanks if you did lol
I had a trio, the friendship was good but it worsened.
They always talked shit about me I lost interest in them and left them and made new friends but I still miss them
Samay badal gaya log chale gaye.
Jav socho ache se toh koi dost toh tha hee nahi.
Yah toh matlab ki duniya thi.
Got ghosted (usually I'm the one who ghosts people)
Usko meri jarurat thi par mai uske bure time me uska saath nahi de payi and after 10th we never talked or meet or usi k baad maine apne andar ka bachpana kho diya .
Wo chali gayi mera ek hissa le kar par syd wo ab nhi lautegi mere zindgi mein.
lost too many of them to count and remember
After a while, i was sick of being the one forcing the conversations, begging her to meet me and always getting ghosted - and her reason?
"I'm busy" yeah well so was I.
I had always been scared of being friendless so i would put up with her treating me like a burden just so that i wouldn't be left all alone - but after 5 years, it was enough.
One fine day i realised I can't let people take me for granted and blocked her from everywhere.
It was hard at first; the loneliness was mortifying, but still less lonely than being friends with her.
If you know what i mean.
I'm so glad I ended it.
My now best friend - she's in med school while I am here in my drop year but she never, ever makes me feel like a burden - always takes out time for me and makes me feel included in her life while being miles away.
It's so effortlessly easy with her - she's my fav person in the whole wide world.
And it suddenly makes sense why it never worked out with my ex bestie.
Friendship breakups kab hue ab to ye bhi yaad nahi h 💔🙃

What's friendship may I ask there's no friendship it's just people talking to each other for their needs and when that purpose is fulfilled they distance themselves from you.
One of them-  My female bestie completely changed when a classmate came into this, I slowly stayed back because I didn't like them, no one broke the ice- plus they assume that I don't wanna be friends with them (3years ago)
We were family friends known each other since childhood I thought she was my bestfriend but realised I wasn't hers after 10th we never talked again met many times acted as if we never knew each other abhi 4 din pehle bhi mili thi we acted as strangers![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30131)
my gf did not like me having a girl bestfriend, i think its toxic too.
was best friends with a girl in 5th.
then covid came and i slowly lost contact as i transcended into clinical depression(actually diagnosed)

https://preview.redd.it/6rd016wnoa0f1.jpeg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adf6d46184f524c10b487ed940051fed68954d2b

bohot dard hota hai when I see her having fun with her friends on instagram.
but it's just a part of life so...yeah

bohot kuch le liya covid ne.
now I don't have any friends.
i feel like crying![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30120)![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30120)
The daily endless conversations ended just cause I pointed out that their actions had hurt me
made new friends and had no time for me, but i know my worth so I left stopped talking silently
My best friend from school made fun of me behind my back called me a pick me, and treated me like a joke because I decided to put myself first.
I lost a 10 year old friendship
If i didn't told her not to talk with me *she wouldn't put a single fight to stay with me* she's like *yeah okay* dgaf type.
I broke up with her
So the tea that she was my friend from like fifth grade or something, and during 10th, I found out that she was talking about me and implying things and spreading rumours on my name and used my family matters against me and spreading everything around the school since I used to talk to everyone, even after that, I didn’t get to cut her off because she was the only friend I ever had.
I kind of distanced myself from her, but during the 11th, she came back to me.
She apologised, but for a fact she still talk shit about me till this day, and I never wanna talk to her ever again like that was the biggest betrayal of my life and no matter how many times she said sorry, it can never be justified.
this one lesbo bitch ruined everything
She got a boyfriend nd preferred him over our 10 years of friendship ( I didn't like him bcoz he was such a flirt)
sab yaha apni friendship breakups ka dukh bata rhe hai meri toh kabhi kisi se dosti hi nhi hui toh breakup ghanta hoga ![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30133)![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30133)
I had a crazy best friend she was just like me, we got along very good then I got into a relationship, some everything went very good, me and my bestie had nothing between us just pure friendship, my gf use to get jealous we started talking less infront of her, after school frequently talked to each other on WhatsApp I took drop, she went to law school nearly 9months we haven't said a word to each other, most of time I messaged her but her energy didn't matched dry replies then I stopped messaging her and well I must say we are no longer bestfriends but somebody that we use to know
Kindly I'm lucky that all of my friends I made in school are still in touch so i really didn't face any kind of friendship breakup till the date
10 years of friendship 
5 years of relationship:)(actually 4 but we considered the one year we liked each other)🥰
She stopped talking to me after being friends for 2 years I still don't know the reason ( bahut dukh hua tha)
I was his only friend, he started picking on me for my choices and all and then I started avoiding him.
Later other things like 11th, 12th, studies and that kind of things also strained the friendship.
Last I spoke to him was in some random exam hall
I had really good friends until I realised they were using me to talk to other people lol.
I tried my best to be with them but they didn't care.
Then they tried to contact me (for some reason) I didn't force things to be with them.
Now I find my own peace and happiness, I wont do things to surprise or make them realise how good I am.
I found better people and I don't force things too much atp, if someone's gonna be my friend, they will even without doing too much.
And if someone's not gonna be with me, even after doing so many efforts, they will leave you at your worst time.
I'm glad I'm not in the toxic friendship anymore!
So we met in an institute and we and we became really good friends in no time we connected because we studied in the same school but in different cities and had a really good time together after sometime.
One of my ex-boyfriend, who was also my friend at that time started showing interest in that girl.
I being very confident on my friendship said that she won’t be talking to you because she’s a good friend of mine, and I don’t want to spoil anything.
Little did I know that she started to talk to him behind my back and told me when they became really good friends.
I was very upset because I did not expect anything from my ex, but was very sure of the friendship I had with her.
After sometime, she started dating him and started saying a lot of things behind my back to our mutual friends.
I was left with no one.
Now she’s an air hostess.
I am working in a digital marketing firm, not earning as much as her.
Sometimes I feel very jealous of her, but I guess this is life.
Maybe I would have done something wrong in the past and I’m getting the karma.
this is my story.
Who is this bbygrl🫣🥵
He was one of my fav person to talk too and bro drained 3 years of pakki dosti for a girl (ig the girl is not anymore with him so aha karma bitch 🔥😝😝)
He was the exact male version of me we'd used to talk sm man i miss this dumbahh...
I hope we meet again in future i would js wanna ask how was everything after stop talking to me how's he been that's it.
One of the coolest nicest Friend i made 
Lol
We were best friends and then he started having feelings for me.
Mera uss samay ek crush tha and usne usko bhaga diya tha ye bolke ki i am his gf![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30120)
If you need to explain yourself too much and second thing if you need to remind them of your existence bcz ab aapki zarurat nhi perhaps unki life mein ...just don't stay !
Just don't ..and leave bcz they were never meant to be there 🙌🏻🙂 the one's who want to stay they do without complains n excuses ...simple
She Just stopped talking n blocked from everywhere, days later saw her posting stories with others.
When confronted said she's done with this n I should move on .
I became toxic and overly dependent on her with abusive parents whereas she had a healthy environment and our lives clashed along with our opinions and I ranted the abuse to her and she was tired and she left.
How to cope up ?
[I became self-absorbed acc to her but how do I explain the abuse]
He knew my crush was in a relationship since 4 years and hid the fact from me for well over 3 years while I suffered
He just stopped replying one day I reached out so many times and he just said "I can't talk now I'm sorry" well ok ig
This is going to be dark
My best friends sister got mud.....rd by one of her bf (yep she has affairs with more than one) the criminal is our neighbour they were and are still nice family i don't know what made that mf (eldest son of the family) to take such steps .
In the same night he convinced his crime by his side.
And few days after he was sentenced jail i don't it was somthing between 5-10year.
And a fine of 2-5lakh.
After few months that family decided to sell their house and went to live somewhere else  .My mom  lent them some money (idk the exact amount between 50k-1lakh) few year back to  run their business .
So the family decided to return our money as ther were moving.
The court had decided the criminal family have to give the victim about 1-2lakh.
But the victims family was constantly trying to make false alligation against the criminal family in order to make more profit.
They also tried to pull us  inthis case saying that we are not witnessing their false alligation and by saying that that criminal family is giving us money to not do that .
We literally helped them to conduct a strike .
Many more but they did what we are not the only one whom they pulled they also pulled another family saying the same shit .
Later tha victim family got caught bribing police to register false alligation severe charges has been registered against the victim family and that police got suspended latter our village decided to isolate them ( as they are harrasshing their own old parents by not letting them live in their own home(which ofcourse built by their parents).
And yahh so meny things happened.
3 year after I heard my best friend got married to a girl he is in 10th I was like wtf .
He is currently smoking drinking.
Sorry for the grammatical mistake.
16 year old friendship ended just beacuse I wanted my time to study
Class 7 me meri first bsf ka mere saath break up ho gaya, and yes, I admit it was my fault.
Woh ek aise ladke ke saath relationship me thi who wasn't right for her and I knew.
I tried to keep it a secret for as long as I could but ek din mummy ko galti se bol diya.
Phir meri mummy and class teacher ne mere se jaan bujhkar sach ugalwaya.
Meri bsf ko pata chal gaya aur abb toh aise bhi baat nahi hoti :'((
I've bawled my eyes out for every single "friendship breakup" I went through.
Probably just as much as I did for my relationship breakups.
Only 3 friendships survived the breakup though (they reconnected, apologized, and I realised I still cared about them in some way, which is why we could gradually rebuild our friendship).
But usually, if I ended a friendship or they did (without me playing a part in it), I let the whole thing bury itself and move tf on, no matter how hard it hurts.
There's no looking back ever.
They crystallise to a soft distant memory in my mind and I just shake my head a little Lil (to clear myself of the nostalgia flooding my brain), anytime I start to romanticise what was.
Best friends till 10th...
now we only speak on our birthdays
Took my friendly,helpful and kind nature as a sign that I was interested in him,and when I said no,slut shammed me everywhere
Lost friends after changing school in 11th but that didn't hurt me cuz I was prepared for it

But when my childhood friend moved that hurt like shit..itna roi thi

Then I used to talk to this guy in discord we used to talk late at night...I genuinely liked talking to him then after 2 months he said he won't be using discord for a few months cuz of studies...usme bhi rona aya tha...pata nahi wapas kab aega...
Us bro 
I fucked up in my relationship and she left me and now I am pretending in front of my friends I don't care about her 

But the truth' is that not talking to her is killing me every day
We were very close, so close that many thought we were dating and suddenly, one fine morning, I did not receive a good morning text from her, very big deal in our case haha, her messages got less frequent and she seemed disinterested.
2 years later, we talked about it and she didn't have any reason for doing what she did and said she regrets ever doing that but was afraid I'd not accept her back into my life if she tried to come back because she knew she wronged me.
Now we barely talk but all's well I guess
Was friends with this guy for like 3-4 years and we were classmates 4 years tak, he used to talk to me really rudely and i never noticed that he doesn’t talk to his other female friends the same way, we were really close and I used to cut off ppl who would treat him badly or smth Ykwim?
But he couldn’t do the same, his arrogance and rude replies, his behaviour with me was soooo bad, but we had 2 mutual female friends unse woh bhot zyada acche se baat krta tha 
Then one day we just cut each other off ig
We were good friends after my breakup like best friends type, but after some time she started saying that mein attention nhi deta, you're not there when I need.
And bro I was but I was busy with my own life also uska bf tha and he did'nt like me, like dikhta tha.
Then I wen in another relationship fir toh usko aur time kam dene laga then wahi ladai etc.
but farewell and last days pe roye gale mile and after last board exam.
She removed me from every social and Its been an year now.
My bestfriend betrayed me many times, we still hangout but I don't have that trust on him.
She was my first friend in a new school.
I thought we'd be good friends, until she started ignoring me.
After asking around, I found out I unknowingly said smth she didn't like so she gave me silent treatment.
I had no self respect back, begged her to come back and apologized.
That happened again, but she involved some more of my new friends so I had no support.
Had a few fights too.
Every time, I was the one at the wrong.
It happened one more time.
Then things were stable till next year.
Then it happened again, this time another friend helped me resolve it.
This time I broke.
I was tired of apologizing and trying to save something which now seems one sided.
So I left her.
We spoke once or twice after that, but not more.
If you are saying it to vent emotions ok but we cant judge ur relationship just by this one line if you want opinions then you need to provide more context
that you in the picture?
Our friendship got broken because of our parents had a fight, from then he stop talking to me , we were in same school still, we just started ignoring eachother, because his parents and my parents Started ignoring eachother
virat kohli breaked up with me and left test cricket 💔
After class 8th.covid happened the whole group never talked to each other again .
my best friend (m) went to the USA with his family, my other best friend (f) well I'll never know, coz she changed her number and she was never on any social media app.
Never could I contact her again(she was the first female friend that " I" made.)  Sed🙂
It was a small fight for a stupid girl, arghhhh
Bro recently I had a very close friend and I lost her due to my mistake because I said something bad about her past which I shoudn't had, immediately I apologised but it was too late she said and now she is ignoring all my texts and phone calls from a month, I even said to her younger sister to say her to pick my calls but I think she hates me now and since then it is hurting me because I did not wanted to hurt her but ig this was it, I gave her space but I think she will never talk to me again.
lost my entire friend group after i moved to a different city.
I shifted back to my Village and she stayed in Chandigarh.
I did hear about her from my cousin who is still in Chandigarh and turns out she has a boyfriend
oh boy I've been through this so many times

A close friend of mine moved when I was in 2nd grade and came back when I entered 5th grade.
Our friendship unfortunately wasn't the same and soon ceased to exist.
When I moved abroad for a couple of years I don't know what went through my head and didn't inform about this sudden decision to anyone.
All my childhood friends suddenly stopped existing, unfortunately I still haven't established contact with any of them.
When my father contracted cancer we came back to India and I once again, lost all my new friends.
A friend of mine from when I was 3 years old  who I, as anyone would, used to consider my best friend started distancing himself fron me inexplicably and finally broke my heart when I found out that he didn't invite me to his birthday party.
I never talked to him after that.
Now I confessed my feelings to my current bestie last month and she didn't reciprocate.
You can guess how that transpired.
This one hurts the most probably because its most recent and she was literally a huge part of my life.
Got cheated on and they supported the girl with whom he cheated on me with , even during the relationship my ex and that other girl were so close it was so fishy and my friends didn't even bother to check on me they just stopped talking to me when I was at my lowest .Finally found better people who are supportive and caring.
Looks like the title is inspired by something

We were friends for 11+ years, family problems arose but I initiated contact and then I got dengue one time and my so-called 'sisters' didn't bother to reach out, ghosted me while I was admitted in hospital during pre boards.
Then I confronted them a few months later, they said that they didn't know as if they don't live 3 houses away from mine.
It was nice while it lasted, I'm over it now.
we were besties for 6 years.
we liked each other for a brief period but never did anything about it.
when i got a bf, he started acting weird.
being close to me, wanting to hangout more, letting other people ship us etc.
and i was confused.
cuz he wouldn’t even bother talking to me in public all of a sudden unless i was talking with some other guy.
he always denied that he liked me.
one day, i was totally sidelined at a group hangout.
i expected him to talk with me given that he’s my bestie but nope.
the moment i start talking to some other guy, he comes up and puts his arms around my neck and starts talking with the guy.
and that pissed me off.
i confronted him that night.
and it’s been 3 years since we talked
We were (3 friends) like family in school never cared what was happening in our surroundings until we were together we never gived a fuck 

Life was hard but we were enjoing it together thought we would always be together.......
Who knew after 10th everyone will be on there own path one changed school one opted for dummy we thought this will not have any effect on our friendship..............
It's been almost two years since i talked with the one who switched school.
He made new friends, I did that too but it doesn't mean that i don't miss that old time


I know breakup hurts a lot
But drifting away with homies suck way more
Had a friend talked alot in summer vacations hours and hours daily became great friends then he got more busy and just stopped messaging and when I msg him he just ignores them maybe just too busy with life
She used to be my best friend ,then all of a sudden we lost contact.
Not a breakup tho but covid ke time she went back to Punjab family ke paas and now we don't talk anymore.
I have her socials but ab vo connection nhi rha so why even bother her.
>!khushi laut aao pls 😭😭!<
She always prioritised her toxic relationships with older guys and girls who supported that bs like getting with older guys since 9th grade.
I stopped calling her my bestfriend we had a few friendship breakups and even last year which was the worst one out of all of them.
I was always looking for growth in between us but she only remembered me when she was sane.
We still talk, are still friends because i reached out to her this year after knowing she's going through some shit.
But haven't called her my bestfriend since dec 2023' maybe once or twice after that because she always insisted on the title but I didn't treat my bestfriends or her like she treated me.
If she wanted the title, then should've earned it.
We're in 12th now.
He couldn't differentiate between a joke and an insult.
back when i was in a hostel in kota  
i was hospitalised after breaking my hand and slitting my lips apart  
that time i obviously couldnt go out to buy anything for me, so i gave almost 1000 rs to a friend i had gotten close with and told her to buy me things i needed like basic bandages or fruits etc  
and the max she would have used out of that was maybe 100 or 200   
after a week, i asked her for the left money because i had gotten better comparatively  
she said there was none left and i felt kind of betrayed  
tried asking her twice or thrice  
each time she couldnt even answer how it was used up  
but anyways  
after that my trust was entirely broken and i couldnt talk to her   
and i was scared to make friends post that during my entire stay there
One of my friend who I knew from 2nd class passed away this year on February 18.
Couldn't even talk to him because of the boards exam.
We also had a minor verbal argument so that's a reason too that we couldn't talk...
Not breakup but long distance friendships really suck like we've been friends for more than 12 years now and live in different states so this really sucks + 2 of them don't even talk to each other now.
It kinda hurts so see the "trio" like this
I had long term beef with her bsf, even blocked her once to let her know that being friends after that just seemed wrong.
Guess who wanted to be friends after that, and guess who definitely became friends with me again and made plans and acted good till the point we had deep talks and brainrots all day only to break off things when her bsf pulled some shit of making her choose.
Her bsf is definitely one of the most insecure people I have met in my life.
Yes when we became friends again I initiated it too.
Both of us were equally in deep but yh.
I didn't feel much hurt because I wouldn't want to give that insecure ugly bitch the pleasure of seeing me hurt😘😍

I lost contact with many of my friends.
But, I never felt bothered by it.
A third guy replaced me and my ex-bestu gaslit me into believing and he had in fact not replaced me and he could never replace me, and that the third new guy was just a casual friend, which I always knew was false and the new guy was not as good to him as I was, and I spent 1 whole year trying to get him back and hopi that he'll see that I'm a much better friend who's actually happy for them, sad for them, excited for them, angry for them, whenever the situation arose, instead of being jealous and condescending like the new guy, and I cried and cried and cried every single time I saw them together for 1 whole year, and this all got over two weeks ago, when I finally got over him 🙃🫠
She left me for her boyfriend
And She used to call me her best friend 
Whom she would never leave....
Now even ahe said that....
U r the reason that her bf broke up with her...
Now she hates me
Chhod na yaar kuch aur baat krte hain
Back in 2021, i had a very dear friend, whom i shall name M.
She and I were always close.
We'd playfully flirt all the time but she'd always initiate and I'd always draw the line.
Then the flirting started becoming suggestive, and then, downright sexual.
Slowly, i started amping up the heat, coz, in my head, it was serious and, i hate to admit it, but, i started developing genuine feelings towards her.
After our one night stand, i proposed to her over text, but she ended up calling me every bad thing under the sun and ended up blocking me.
I tried and tried to make things right but to no avail.
Honestly the next 3 months leading up to my boards were pure agony, but in the end, i deleted all the chat logs, cleared out my gallery and moved tf on.
That was when i swore myself off dating.
Still going single 4 years later
She and I were besties since kindergarten after covid we befriended 2 new girls and a trio type of situation happened and yeah she started ignoring me and we kinda drifted apart and later I found out that the  three of them including my besties were bitching about me I felt soo bad cause back then I had like no friends and stuff and often got bullied(cause i literally never like spoke up)but yeah now I pretty much am out of that phase and found amazing friends 

We live close to each other and our parents are friends and it's awkward when we meet sometimes.
I think this kind of stuff only exist in girls friendship...
(Don't get me wrong )
We used to write long letters to each other every day through slowly app, explaining our whole day and how we loved sharing a story with each other, one day she stopped writing to me, waiting till this day
She was pretty much my first actual real irl friend and it lasted a few months ig.
I got super attached to her.
She was possessive af tho and wanted me to talk to noone other than her.
We had fights over why tf i would talk to x (before she even arrived at the school.
What else is a person supposed to do when their best friend and isnt there and another friend is?).
Then she told *me* that im limiting her freedom and have objection on what she eate, where she goes, who she talks to yada yada bc i told her to sit tf down in a class w no teacher when she was going around running wildly.
She threatened suicide and stuff to me, said she’d leave the school this year (we were in 9th so she wanted to leave after 9th finals.
She still hasnt left 🥰) and guilt tripped me in a whole lotta ways.
Finally when our friendship broke, the next month she “apologised” and became friends again.
Just friends this time.
Then it broke again and 10th grade stArted, and i think in may she asked me to be best friends again and i was like um okay ill think ab it (i just didnt have the coursge to say no).
I had already made a genuine true friend by then and shes my bsf even now, and i told her ab this and we pretty much laughed and ranted ab it bc this friend was also my bitchy ex bsf’s ex bsf so she betrayed before me.
Anyway finally our friendship broke up for the last time when she talked shit ab me and spewed lies ab what i had apparently told her (I hadn’t) ab a certain friend to that friend.
That bitch believed her btw so i think i have real bad taste in friends
She still talks to people who bitched about me....
and, I still talk to her...
because she was my first friend in my new school and I can't let her go....
(We're not in daily contact since her parents forbid her from phone use.) 


So, even tho I know this isn't exactly a breakup.
It's still a heartbreak.
had been talking since 6 months, she just got to know that one 4th class embrassing moment and left, I'm in 12th rn btw, smth i did 8 fuckin years ago, She just suddenly stopped talking, at first I thought that I might have said something wrong but I talked to her friend and then got to know
I had a really close friendship with a girl for four years, but she left me because her crush liked me, and she started seeing me as her rival.
After that, she began talking badly about me to others, like our friendship had meant nothing at all.
Since then, I’ve stopped believing in all that ‘friendship stuff’—it just doesn’t feel real anymore
Change my mind:
Friendship breakup hurts more than relationship breakup
At some point i realised it was a trauma bond 
I have always been an introvert he helped me but in the process i became too selfish, lots of things happened and here we are now nothing back to being nothing 
Do i regret anything ig yess but ik it's my fault but idk i was just a 15 years old
Left with a goodbye on the last day of school year, didn't know the importance of goodbyes back then
I've had very good friends in class 8.
After coming to class 9,  they've all forgotten me like I never existed.
Well I guess that's how life goes on 🤷
My mercy triumphs over their sins and everything they’ve done to me.
I’m grateful for my kindness because it allows me to live without carrying heaviness in my heart.
I’ve cleared everything from within, so even after all that’s happened, I still meet them as if there’s no pain inside me.
And the truth is — I have nothing left for them but a warm smile and a heartwarming welcome.
I had two best friends—people who I couldn't live without.
I moved to another city for JEE prep, only to find out five months later that they’d been in a relationship the whole time… hiding it from me like it was some top-secret mission.
They stopped contacting me at all so eventually he kinda ghosted me 🤷‍♀️
There was a girl who was friends with me we were not that close in school she had her own friend group.
Later we lived in the same city for a while so we became friends.
When i befriended she would make up embarrassing stories about me and say i did that while growing up.
She would not share about her life like her marks or relationships but would want to know all about mine.
So i ghosted her as I was tired of bs, it was v draining.
At the start of grade 11th she got jealous of my new friends and broke our friendship
My best friend stopped being my best friend overnight and when I went to get results she didn't even look at me
I had good friends- that’s what I used to believe.
I went through a very rough phase at personal, financial, career during 2015-2018.
To my surprise each one of them left by giving lame excuses- at one instance a girl who was my rakhi sister for 10 + years a strong bond between us fought and stopped talking over a very lame joke which resulted in not talking since 10 years- similarly a friend of 13 years fought over Rs 200 said mean things and left and many more

There was a time I used to be surrounded with a very good friend circle but now its me n work and no friends and those who are there are like once a year talk for 2-3 mins kindoff.
I left school for coaching we tried being friends after that too but they started ignoring me
Used to talk to the guy everyday for 2 months suddenly he disappeared
a friend of mine died in a car accident, its been 5 years he was 18 at that time
She played victim in every situation, gaslighted us into thinking her bf had caused the problem(he used be our friend), told the bitchings to the same girl who we used to bitch together taking my and my other friend's name
Idc and forgot about most of my friendship breakups.
2 which hurt me the most.
we were in a competitive zone and I got left behind and chose a diff path.
It's not like we had a last fight or smtg but we haven't talked in last 2 years
He stood with me when everyone betrayed me and left me when i had everyone again, i wanted him to be the part of everyone but since he left me i always felt alone in the crowd, though the crowd loved
**Bruh the timing of your post...
I had to make an account just to vent.
M19 here.**

I am shitty guy, I have had anger issues since childhood and I have tried to controlled them but that dont work sometimes.
In school I used to backbitch other ppl in the group just so I can be good one of the friends who had more toys and shit.
He even gifted me a fucking quadcopter and I have stopped talking with him.
I used to bully a "friend" who lived in the same apartment as me.
I used to get jealous when my best friend used to vibe well with others and shout and cry at him.
I emotionally manipulated him once without knowing that its called emotional manipulation (7th-8th ki baat hai) Masti karke mein dusro ka naam de deta tha aur bach jata cause I had a innocent face and I was the topper in the school.
My mom takes tuition classes and one of my classmate slipped and broke his hand (It literally bent) People were ringing door bells and I ignored that cause I was busy simping with my female friends (yes simping).
This 9th or 10th.
Then in 11th-12th I started knowing some of this shit and started to get better bit by bit becoming concious abt things.
Then, there came a girl she came in the tuition and I kinda liked her, I started talking with her online and shit and my mom noticed and scolded me very badly, without closure I ghosted her.
Then in same period came another girl she is an angel in disguise of person in terms of beauty as well as personality, we talked a lot (I became better at hiding shit after previous incident).
I could not help but fall for her man.
She felt comfortable so much so she sat beside for a while and shit, but my jealous ass couldnt handle the fact she talked late night with my friend, I slowly started ghosting her because of that and that chapter closed (until now).
Then, Ig karma started striking me back.
Then started college, I made good friends both male and female, we used to have so much fun in the first sem, My shitty ass bullied and made fun of other male friends to make female friends laugh(I was such a downbad person).
Once my female friends and I were hanging (rest male friends of the group were busy with somethings).
Some other batch-mates came in creepy way and my female friends made fun that I once by slip of tongue said "I like men", I don't even remember it.
Unknowingly I was rude sometimes to my friends.
So i slowly started to drift away from female friends and found another group.
Apparently looking back I feel one of the girl liked me.
Anyways, same story I was shitty to the people in new group and as a result by second sem they started to drift away from me.
Not to mention they were also shitty to me, like I would check on them when they sick and offer them basic meds and helped them academically by giving notes, previous year papers etc, they never did any of that in return.
I used to call them for dinner so we can have it together, If I was ordering anything I asked them if they wanted to as well, made efforts for movie nights etc, but nothing much in return.
In one of the movie nights I grabbed one of the friend by neck and shouted at him because he was teasing me by a girls name and telling others well.
I shouldn't have done that I know and I realized it later.
Then from a literature project came a girl, she was sooo fun to talk with, she is the same girl by whose name my friend used to tease me, I was discussing politics, and random bs to her like she was my bro since eternity esp in the summer vacation, she started giving me cute nicknames like "Pookie" and called be cutie, my dumb ass was not seeing clear asf signs she was giving.
We used to go for campus rounds and hangout sometimes, but in 3rd semester something changed in her, she started talking less and less with me, At one point If I forgot to text her for a day she would say "bro forgot me" now she would not see messages sometimes for a while and became disinterested to talk online and irl.
She replied to me rudely twice and I tried asking if something happened but no was answer everytime.
Eventually she found another good friend with whom she used to study and library and stuff.
In April I saw them holding hands, I understood the case.
I cried for her so many times wondering what did I do.
Coupled with the academic pressure since 3rd sem I was barely having a day without sobbing thoughts.
Coupled with weird treatment from boys group It was battle everyday.
I also did a bad thing with her which I regret, She once sharing her trauma with me, We were very new friends and I told her to stop remembering it for sake of sharing it will make her feel worse, She didnt stop, I return blocked her temporarily, I realized I was such an asshole doing that.
The boys group got divided into subgroups, and they helped each other, solving doubts , hanging out and what not , I was part of none.
In the vacations after second sem, I decided to quit instagram for good, the girl from the first group messaged me on whatsapp and said whom will I share cat videos with (I am big cat lover).
That also died down quickly.
The boys group on my birthday didnt even bothered to cut cake, I fucking gave them pizza party.
In all others birthday they used to cut cake and have fun (College wala bday pta hee hai kaisa hota hai).
Only a few people remembered my birthday.
In boys group I shared a course with two of my friends and told others if they need they can ask me for account details anytime.
Those two bought course and never offered me, I gave the course for free.
In start of third sem, one of that friend made a hackathon team without offering me a place, that pissed me off and I got angry on him in front of others, I thought he considered me his best friend but alas I was wrong, mind you they were not taking part seriously just to get an experience.
Fourth Sem had been just lonely asf with no one to connect to and talk to, I shared everything (Academic) I got to my friends but they never did.
The girl drifted even further away.
Then during the fest came message of the angel of a person I talked about earlier, she came along with my sis and we enjoyed so much in fest.
Those were My happiest days since 2024.
My ass didnt bother to apologize to her as well.
While returning she texted me "don't disappear like before" thats when it all hit me.
Well ig its karma or shes really busy shes lately not seeing messages (I anyways deserve it for what I did to her).
I cried because of the shitty ass of person I am and lonely have I become.
Theres so much in between this is most I can compress to.
I’m not looking for pity.
I just needed to say this somewhere.**
She became friends with my friend and started behaving differently.
Then one night, we had a fight.
I casually swore at her as a joke, especially since she had done it before too.
But she got offended and later told everyone at college what I had said.
I apologized, but after that, we never spoke again.
The friend who was originally mine started dating her, and now neither of them are my friends anymore.
I also started feeling jealous seeing the two of them together, even though I had liked her before.
My best friend, whom I helped to get out of being suicidal, leaves me for someone else...but on the bright side, I am happy for her by the way she has changed.
Though I'm sad to be with her to experience her new version.
Oh no, friendship breakups hit so differently like a slow ache instead of a sharp cut.
They can be even more confusing because there’s often no big dramatic moment, just a slow drifting apart, or a weird shift where someone who used to feel like home starts feeling like a stranger.
Sometimes it’s just time.
One moment you’re sending each other memes at 2 a.m., and the next you’re watching them view your story but never reply.
And it hurts because losing a friend feels like losing part of your history.
After 12th i barely talk to anyone.
Only met a friend from school twice after 12th then never spoke properly again
He used to threaten me about dying lol whenever I didn't agree to his opinions  
One day I got fed up and said just try it   
He never contacted me again and bithced about me to the entire school lol.
She changed school --> reconnected on insta after 2-3yrs --> Talked there for like 1-2yrs --> Never met offline --> She changed city for college --> Stopped talking eventually (still flw each other tho)
In 11th standard, my friend of 7 years ran away from her house for a boy (no, he didn't convince her) so I just stopped talking to her and it's been 4 years .
I called her my bestie.
But everyone else around me constantly warned me about her.
My other friends, my teachers, even my mother.
But I didn't listen.
She got me hooked to alcohol, clubbing, and frequent dating.
I found it to be fun when it started, but she was forcing me to go on one night stands, so that I could "enjoy life." After that, I slowly started distancing myself from her, and stopped drinking altogether.
No drinks, no clubs, no dating.
According to her, I was "dragging her down" Because I couldn't keep up with her lifestyle.
She herself blocked me everywhere because I wouldn't listen to her.
This was almost Seven years ago.
I almost got groomed and because of one girl I was kicked out of the group and i only had connection with a friend in the grp only to realise few years later I was blocked
19M So yea, i m glad that finally smne asking this anyways so there was this guy whom i met in class 4 and we became good friends soon and also good students of the class, we were great and spent our friendship together for straight 6 years we changed even our schools together and moved to the same school for the good of our friendship and brotherhood but soon after when we got into different sections, not very long he changed his attitude, i was like bro why, then he really forgot our friendship and yea today i m here typing this, its been 5 years since we are separated
We were inseperable in Mumbai, I moved to Raigarh (CG) aand it all fell apart.
Got my mobile stolen last friday night...
Didn't spoke to him since then.
Chating didn't come near as a hour long call.
I made friends with her at school, her group got jealous they imagined i would steal her from them..
super childish things they do

They manipulated her into sending me hate msgs ![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|30133)

So yes aap apni bhi kahaniya bataye ☕
A friend of mine borrowed some money from me and disappeared, like, bro you could've just told me that you won't be able to pay me back.
Its a simple three Friend group and I made a terrible huge mistake(mini-Business when we were in college).
It was like a immature thinking from my side.
So we had our quarrels.
And I outed myself.
Really miss those guys, wish i should have said no to the idea at the initial stage would have been great.
Note: Business didn't go well and the other one quit later.
8th ke baad kisi ladki se thik se baat hi nhi kri and that means a lot because i am 2 years dropper after 12th 😭😭 boy school ka shrap 😭😭
i was friends with a girl for almost 2 years, she liked a guy, she used to hangout with him telling her mom she was hanging out with me.
so eventually everytime she wanted to go out with him i used to accompany her, cause free food, i never had a single proper conversation except for hi bye and how are yous, i used to scroll my phone whenever I thirs wheeled them and when she finally confessed to him, he rejected and her and told he liked me, she started getting angry on me, started to hate me, started getting distant and ghosted me eventually.
she's on my socials still but i never spoke to her again.
breaks my heart to loose such a nice friend, my mom still asks what happened to her, why we don't talk anymore but I just say we got busy with our own stuff.
https://preview.redd.it/xfezttu4db0f1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8728978cec74afa6514018b15319d7e628bf08d

I knew her for 10 years, for 6 years we were best friends.
One day, she just left.
No reason, no fight.
I still don't know why it happened.
I never got the chance to ask her, she never told me.
Nobody was ever part of my daily routine.
Maybe I am extremely antisocial
She had a boyfriend, showed me her " Old crush" And invited him out with us.
We all vibed no big deal.
Now I'm the villian(called me homewrecker because her crush started liking me!) Relax , I didn't break the girl code..
I know the rules...
y'all can downvote but I love abandoning people like without telling them the reason I just leave them if they ever made me feel less, even if they are closest to me .
no window straight cut .
Among my 3 friends, i started earning early, left the school, didn't do graduation.
My friends were in 12th when I started earning.
While they were in college, spending their father's money,
I used to spend after my friends for things like casual outings, dinners, fuel etc which was quite low for that time and situation but when they graduated and started earning well , and I had a rough patch after Covid, people started splitting bills and shit while earlier 3 out of 5 times I used to pay and never asked about their part nor they even put efforts.
So I just dropped 1 of the friend.
While other friend, who started working for his father, expanded the business, started earning well for himself from the business supported me, cared for my family as well.
And it brakes my heart to let the other friends go because I have known him for more than half of my life and mf started treating me like I am nothing and I own him for something
For me , I'm the one who left her :).
She always wanted sex and fun with me but deep down I always wanted to sit with her on bus stop and just yapping or listen to her yapping with me and worst part is i never flirted with her or tried to show her that I want her and she kept telling everyone that I love her and I'm "AASHIQ" .
Felt kinda betrayed so i left :)) .
But best part is just after 5 days I got into relationship with another girl and it's been more than 3 months I never felt sad with her and she always took care of me
Lost and entire group of friends over political arguments
List is long 😭
Well let’s just say I was ghosted once that was unexpected yeah and the other ones may be another day 😭😭
Omg dude I've had so many ive lost count.
I just started ignoring people if I think they're inconvenient, and then my doctor told me im psychopathic.
Not even friendship but meta tota mar gaya saala
We used to be inseparable.
She was 3 years younger than me and was in my school.
Initially she tried to isolate me from the rest of the group saying they were bad and shit and then she herself used to go and talk to em.
I mean if you feel someone is bad why would u go and talk to em?
I overlooked this major red flag and continued to get brainwashed by her.
She went and bitched about my secrets to the same group and made sure they hated me to the core.
After getting brainwashed for around 2 years and decided to take a firm stance and end it with her.
She got jealous and seduced my bf.
I’m not a girls girl anymore thanks to her.
My best friend of 12 years drifted apart from me during Covid.
The third person in our group joined a year before the pandemic.
Meanwhile, they bonded over BTS and One Direction, often chatting and video-calling.
I prefer not to text or video-call, which might have contributed to the distance.
Additionally, I sense that my friend's mother wasn't too fond of me..
Anyway i am happy now
Bro I lost my friends and my girl in less than 15 days, goes on to show human touch is temporary, focus on work n experiences.
lagta hai tu wahi ladki hai jo mujhse abhi baat nai kar ri
We got into a lil argument and said multiple things to each other and at last he said something very disrespectful.
I was mad at him for a day or two but when he didn't text me for almost a week all the anger vanished away and I was hoping for him to text me but even after months he didn't I even tried to initiate a conversation with him once but it didn't work and we haven't spoken to each other since that day.I was very attached to him and it hurted me alot when I saw him replying on other girl's comments on reddit (we also met here) asking them politely to be his friend while I was still hoping he would text me.
So I just blocked him on reddit.
He's on my ig but I barely use instagram anymore so I don't mind it.Idk if he even considered me his friend or not but I did.
I even thought of going college together (as we both are preparing for entrance).
Didn't knew that even strangers you meet online can mean alot to you and hurt you.But I hope whatever he's doing nowadays and whoever he talks to and is friends with he's happy but yeah less happier than me.I hope I don't sound crazy ;)
Small things were dissappearing in my house and when I asked her about it she didn't know what I was talking about.
One day I saw her taking a 5 euro bill and pocketing it, when I asked her about it she played dumb and blamed my girlfriend, took her 3 days to confess that and many other similar incidences.
I was ready to forgive and forget but when she confessed she insisted that it was not stealing, it was just "some thing she did ocasionally" and that rubbed me off in the wrong way since to me that says "don't care won't stop".
Just lost someone who was part of my daily routine and now I see this post right after losing him......
like damn the internet really knows how to poke your feelings 🥲💔
Had a friend of many years .
Even after school we were close .
Daily calls and occasionally meeting.
And suddenly one day , I woke up in the morning and she blocked me everywhere.
I tried contacting her , but then I stopped .
Don't know what happened.
Ditched plans with me for dinner to this really fancy place (that we had planned a month ago) to hangout with her ‘crush’
Jayada kuch nahi I was just left out![img](emote|t5_2zhzn|20609)
i would constantly feel left out in my friends grp.
so i decided to confront them.
Obv they got super defensive and we had a fight.
we stopped talking from the next lecture not even the next day.
i realised I wa not valued in that grp.
it was super fake.
im at peace now.
ive better frnds now.
she somewhat ghosted me after 10th grade.
I was the first to initiate conversations, she was the first to end them, always.
She's my crush and friend but i confessed now things are fading..( everything will end in 2-3 months between us)
low karma can't post upvote dedo
One of the my group friend snitched on me with his gf about some info, then her gf told the entire group about it..
i left the entire friend circle afterwards.
He is such a dumbass, not knowing what confidentiality is..
anyways, since then I've been living way better than before, and rarely having conversation with the real ones of that group..
(BTW this happened to me almost 3 months ago)
Life set h !!

Colonel sanders started kfc when he was 65
I got hit in my balls and here is what happened
So a normal day of cricket was happening,I was pulling up of my worst performances today and was in a sed mood

Suddenly,The batsman hit the ball and it landed just above the scrotum(thank godd).I immediately fell down shivering in the sand while others started to gather around me.Someone asked whether i was crying or moaning(i was making strange sounds lmao).I gathered up the power to get up and walk to the water cooler.On the way,I started hallucinating and my eyes started to blur.I fell down and laid flat on the footpath.
Then a good friend of mine came to see what had happened to me and saw me laying on the footpath.He helped me get up and made me sleep on a bench while he went and got chilled water from the store.I drank it and after sometime he helped me get to home.
I came home and went straight to the bed and turned on the AC and fan and just laid on the bed.My mother came to check on me and I said I had hit my balls.She checked for any visible injuries and brought ice for me to spread on the area.I am currently trying to soak my balls in the bowl with the ice and eating pasta.

Bro my deepest apologies but that line you mentioned "Someone asked wether I was crying or moaning" This one really cracked me up and I couldn't stop laughing while imagining your state.
Even whole writing this I am 🤣🤣🤣.
But still take care, it hurts as hell in those places

May god give you strength (to reproduce)🤓

Anyone who hates these is my friend without introduction
Always had a personal hatred for these shoes.
Would always purposefully skip over them, because everytime I did collect them accidentally, I'd get myself unalived.
LIKE I REALLY DISLIKE THESE WRETCHED SHOESSS.
Mfs just end up killing you when you are about to break ur personal record
Those were though a blessing when two trains come simultaneously and we are stuck in between
same vro like i can’t accustom myself to jumping double height and halving my projectile horizontal component in like milliseconds
I love them 😁
I'll just activate the **emergency double click** response(hoverboard)😎
these are my favourite powerups bro what the hell
I tried to see them as barricades, avoiding them as much as I could.
Even if I do get them accidentally, I would avoid jumping in them 😂
Fr man, baar baar galti se mil jate the, useless fr 😔
Me too I've always avoided these shoes in the game.
Now I can proudly that I haven't even by mistakenly collected them.
Always tried my hardest to avoid them.
Worst game item by far.
I hated them but I can't forget the fact that they helped me clear the leaderboard lmao.
Yes only good things were pogostick and jet
Nah these are goated u js dk how to use them
They're so situational like omg just gimme a jetpack damnit!
Those are good only if u know how to use them
This * (and skill issue)
fuck this bhai bekar
I Guess we are bestfriends
Us bro us don't like it 


Jabhi bhi ek train se jump Marta hu piche Wale se takra jata hu
